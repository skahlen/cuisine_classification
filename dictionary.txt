This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the

TO 

MRS. WILLIAM B. SEWALL, 

iPrtsiDent of ti)e Boston Cooittnfl«dd)ool, 

Uf APPRECIATION OF HER HELPFUL ENCOURAGEMENT AND 

UNTIRING EFFORTS IN PROMOTING THE WORK OF 

SCIENTIFIC COOKERY, WHICH MEANS THE 

ELEVATION OF THE HUMAN RACE, 

THIS BOOK IS AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATED 
Bt THE Author. 



Cookery means the knowledge of Medea and of Circe 
and of Helen and of the Queen of Sheba, It means the 
knowledge of all herbs and fruits and balms and spices, and 
all that is healing and sweet in the fields and groves and 
savory in meats. It means carefulness 'and inventiveness 
and willingness and readiness of appliances. It means the 
economy of your grandmothers and the science of the modern 
chemist; it means much testing and no wasting; it means 
English thoroughness and French art and Arabian hospi- 
tality ; andf in fine, it means that you are to be perfectly and 
always ladies — loaf givers. — Ruskin. 



PEE FACE. 



"But for life the universe were nothing; and all 
that has life requires nourishment" 

With the progress of knowledge the needs of the 
human body have not been forgotten. During-the last 
decade much time has been given by scientists to the 
study of foods and their dietetic value, and it is a 
subject which rightfully should demand much con- 
sideration from all. I certainly feel that the time is 
not far distant when a knowledge of the principles of 
diet will be an essential part of one's education. Then 
mankind will eat to live, will be able to do better 
mental and physical work, and disease will be less 
frequent. 

At the earnest solicitation of educators, pupils, and 
friends, I have been urged to prepare this book, and I 
trust it may be a help to many who need its aid. It 
is my wish that it may not only be looked upon as a 
compilation of tried and tested recipes, but that it may 
awaken an interest through its condensed scientific 
knowledge which will lead to deeper thought and 
broader study of what to eat

POOD. 



T^OOD is anything which nourishes the body. Thirteen 
-*- elements enter into the composition of the body ; 
oxygen, 62J%; carbon, 21i%; hydrogen, 10%; nitrogen, 
3% ; calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, chlorine, 
sodium, magnesium, iron, and fluorine the remaining 3%. 
Others are found occasionally, but, as their uses are un- 
known, will not be considered. 

Food is necessary for growth, repair, and energy ; there- 
fore the elements composing the body must be found in 
the food. The thirteen elements named are formed into 
chemical compounds by the vegetable and jnimal king- 
doms to support the highest order of being, man. All 
food must undergo chemical change after being taken into 
the body, before it can be utilized by the body ; this is 
the office of the digestive system. 

Food is classified as follows : — 



1^- 

(3. 



Proteid (nitrogenous or albuminous). 
I. Organic -^ 2. Carbohydrates (sugar and starch). 
Fats and oils. 

TT T ^«« *..^ ( !• Mineral matter. 
11. Inorganic ¦{ ^ „^ ^ 

i 2. Water. 



2 BOSTON COOIONG-SCHOOL COOK BOOK, 

The chief office of proteids is to build and repair tissues. 
They can furnish energy, but at greater cost than carbo- 
hydrates, fats, and oils. They contain nitrogen, carbon, 
oxygen, hydrogen, and sulj^hur or phosphorus, and include 
all forms of animal foods (excepting fats and glycogen) 
and some vegetable foo<is. Examples : milk, cheese, eggs, 
meat, fish, cereals, peas, beans, and lentils. The princi- 
pal constituent of proteid food is albumen. Albumen 
as found in food takes different names, but has the same 
clwmical composition ; as, albumen in eggs^Jibrhi in meat, 
casein in milk and cheese, vegetable casein or legume n in 
peas, beans, and lentils ; and gluten in wheat. To this 
same class belongs gelatine. 

The chief office of the carbohydrates is to furnish 
energy and maintain heat. They contain carbon, hydrogen, 
and oxygen, and include foods containing starch and sugar. 
Examples: vegeta])les, fruits, cereals, sugars, and guuis. 

The chief office of fats and oils is to store energy and 
heat to be used as needed, and constitute the adipose 
tissues of the body. Examples ; butter, cream, fat of 
meat, fish, cereals, nuts, and the berry of the olive-tree. 

The chief office of mineral matter is to furnish tbe 
necessary salts which are found in all animal and vege- 
table foods. Examples : sodium chloride (common salt) ; 
carbonates, sulphates and phosphates of sodium, ix)tas- 
sium, and magnesium; l)osides calcium phosphates and 
iron. 

AVater constitutes about two-thirds the weight of the 
body, and is in all tissues and fluids ; therefore its abun- 
dant use is necessary. One of the greatest errors in diet 
is neglect to take enough water ; while it is found in all 
animal and vegetable food, the amount is insufficient. 

CORRECT PROPORTIONS OP POOD. 

Age, sex, occupation, climate, and season must deter- 
mine the diet of a person in normal condition. 

Liquid food (milk or milk in i)reparation with the vari- 



CORRECT PROPORTIONS OF FOOD. 8 

OU8 prepared foods on the market) should constitute the 
diet of a child for the first eighteen mouths. After the 
teeth appear, by which time fennents have been developed 
for the digestion of starchy foods, entire wheat bread, 
baked potatoes, cereals, meat broths, and occasionally 
boiled eggs may be given. If mothers would use Dr. 
Johnson's Educators in -place of the various sweet crack- 
ers, children woukl be as well pleased and better nour- 
ished; with a glass of milk they form a supper suited to 
the needs of little ones, and experience has shown chil- 
<lren seldom tire of them. The diet should be gradually 
increased by the addition of cooked fruits, vegetables, 
and simple desserts; the third or fourth year fish and 
meat may be introduced, if given sparingly. Always 
avoid salted meats, coarse vegetables (l)eets, carrots, and 
turnips), cheese, fried food, pastry, rich desserts, con- 
fections, condiments, tea, coffee, and iced water. For 
school children the diet shonld be varied and abundant, 
constantly bearing in mind that this is a period of great 
mental and physical growth. Where children have broken 
down, supposedly from over-work, the cause has often 
l)een traced to impoverished diet. It must not be forgot- 
ten that digestive processes go on so rapidly that the 
stomach is soon emptied. Thanks to the institutor of 
the school luncheon-counter! 

The daily average ration of an adult requires 

3)^ oz. proteid. 10 oz. starch. 

3 oz. fat. 1 oz. salt. 

5 pints water. 

About one- third of the water is taken in our food, the 
remainder as a beverage. To keep in health and do the 
best mental and physical work, authorities agree that 
a mixed diet is suited for temperate climates, although 
sound arguments appear from the vegetarian. Women, 
even though they do the same amount of work as men, as 
a rule require less food. Brain workers should take their 
proteid in a form easily digested. In consideration of this 



4 BOSTON COOKTKG-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

fact, fish and eggs form desirable substitutes for meat. 
The working man needs quantity as well as quality, that 
the stomach may have something to act upon. Corned 
beef, cabbage, brown-bread, and pastry will not overtax 
his digestion. In old age the digestive organs lessen in 
activity, and diet should be almost as simple as that of 
a child, increasing the amount of carbohydrates and 
decreasing the amount of proteids and fat. 

WATER (HjO). 

Water is a transparent, odorless, tasteless liquid. It is 
derived from five sources, — rains, rivers, surface-water 
or shallow wells, deep wells, and springs. Water is never 
found pure in nature ; it is nearly pure when gathered in 
an open field, after a heavy rainfall, or from springs. 
For. town and city supply, surface-water is furnished by 
some adjacent pond or lake. Samples of such water are 
carefully and frequently analyzed, to make sure that it is 
not polluted with disease germs. 

The hardness of water depends upon the amount of salts 
of lime and magnesia which it contains. Soft water is free 
from objection a] )le salts, and is preferable for household 
purposes. Hard water may be softened by boiling, or by 
the addition of a small amount of bicarbonate of soda 
(NallCOa). 

Water freezes at a temperature of 32° F., boils at 
212° F. ; when bubbles appear on the surface and burst, 
the boiling-point is reached. In high altitudes water boils 
at a lower temperature. From 32° to 65° F. water is 
termed cold; from 6o° to 92° F. tepid; 92° to 100° F. 
warm ; over that temperature, hot. Boiled water is freed 
from all organic impurities, and salts of lime are precipi- 
tated ; it does not ferment, and is a valual)le antiseptic. 
Hot water is more stimulating than cold, and is of use 
taken on an empty stomach, while at a temperature of 
from 60° to 95° F. it is used as an emetic; 90° F. being 
the most favorable temperature. 



STARCH. 5 

Distilled water is chemically pure and is always used 
for medicinal purposes. It is flat and insipid to the taste, 
having been deprived of its atmospheric gases. 

There are many chained, carbonized, and mineral spring 
waters bottled and put on the market; many of these 
are used as agreeable table beverages. Examples : Soda 
water, ApoUinaris, Poland, Seltzer, and Vichy. Some 
contain minerals of medicinal value. Examples: Lithia, 
saline, and sulphur waters. 

SALTS. 

Of all salts found in the body, the most abundant 
and valuable is sodium chloride (NaCl), common salt; 
it exists in all tissues, secretions, and fluids of the 
body, with exception of enamel of the teeth. The 
amount found in food is not always sufldcient ; therefore 
salt is used as a condiment. It assists digestion, inas- 
much as it furnishes chlorine for hydrochloric acid found 
in gastric juice. 

Common salt is obtained from evaporation of spring 
and sea water, also from mines. Our supply of salt ob- 
tained by evaporation comes chiefly from Michigan and 
New York; mined salt from Louisiana and Kansas. 

Salt is a great preservative ; advantage is taken of this 
in salting meat and flsh. 

Other salts — lime, phosphorus, magnesia, potash, sul- 
phur, and iron — are obtained in sufficient quantity from 
food we eat and water we drink. In young children, 
perfect formation of bones and teeth depends upon phos- 
phorus and lime taken into the system ; these are found 
in meat and fish, but abound in cereals. 

STARCH (CeHioOB). 

Starch is a white, glistening powder ; it is largely dis- 
tributed throughout the vegetable kingdom, being found 
most abundantly in cereals and potatoes. Being a force- 
producer and heat-giver, it forms one of the most impor- 



6 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

tant foods. Alone it cannot sustain life, but must be 
taken in combination with foods which build and repair 
tissues. 

Test for Starch. A weak solution of iodine added to 
cold cooked starch gives an intense blue color. 

Starch is insoluble in cold water, almost soluble in 
boiling water. Cold water separates starch-grains, boil- 
ing water causes them to swell and burst, thus forming a 
paste. 

Starch subjected to heat is changed to dextrine 
(CeHioOfi), British gum. Dextrine subjected to heat plus 
an acid or a ferment is changed to dextrose (CgHiaOe). 
Dextrose occurs in ripe fruit, honey, sweet wine, and as 
a manufactured product. When grain is allowed to ger- 
minate for malting purposes, starch is changed to dex- 
trine and dextrose. In fermentation, dextrose is change<l 
to alcohol (C2U5HO) and carbon-dioxide (CO2). Ex- 
amples : Bread-making, vinegar, and distilled liquors. 

Glycogen, animal starch, is found in many animal tis- 
sues and in some fungi. Examples : In liver of meat and 
oysters. 

Raw starch is not digestible ; consequently all foods 
containing starch should be subjected to boiling water, 
and thoroughly cooked. Starch is manufactured from 
wheat, corn, and potatoes. Corn-starch is manufactured 
from Indian corn. Arrowroot, the purest form of starch, 
is obtained from two or three species of the Maranta 
l)lant, which grows in the West Indies and other tropical 
countries. Bermuda arrowroot is most highly esteemed. 
Tapioca is starch obtained from tul serous roots of the 
bitter cassava, native of South America. Sago is starch 
obtained from sago palms, native of India. 

SUGAR (CiJI^oOn). 

Sugar is a crystalline substance, differing from starch 
by its sweet taste and solubility in cold water. As food. 



SUGAR. 7 

its uses are the same as starch ; all starch must be con- 
verted iuto sugar before it can be assimilated. 

The principal kinds of sugar are : Cane sugar or sucrose^ 
grape sugar or glucose (CelliaOe), milk sugar or lactose 
(CijHaaOn), and fruit sugar or levulose (CalliaOc). 

Cane sugar is obtained from sugar cane beets, and the 
palm and sugar-maple trees. Sugar cane is a grass sup- 
posed to be native to Southern Asia, but now grown 
throughout the tropics, a large amount coming from Cuba 
and Louisiana; it is the commonest and sweetest of all, 
and in all cases the manufacture is essentially the same. 
The products of manufacture are : Molasses, syrup, brown 
sugar, loaf, cut, granulated, powdered, and confectioners* 
sugar. Brown sugar is cheapest, but is not so pure or 
sweet as white grades; powdered and confectioners' 
sugars are tine grades, pulverized, and, although seeming 
less sweet to the taste, are equally pure. Confectioners* 
sugar when applied to the tongue will dissolve at once ; 
powdered sugar is a little granular. 

Cane sugar when added to fruits, and allowed to cook 
for some time, changes to grape sugar, losing one-third 
of its sweetness ; therefore the reason for adding it when 
fruit is nearly ccoked. Cane sugar is of great preserva- 
tive value, hence its use in preserving fruits and milk ; 
also, for the preparation of syrups. 

Three changes take place in the cooking of sugar: 
First, barley sugar; second, caramel; third, carbon. 

Grape sugar is found in honey and all sweet fruits. It 
appears on the outside of dried fruits such as raisins, 
dates, etc., and is only two- thirds as sweet as cane sugar. 
As a manufactured product it is obtained from the starcii 
of corn. 

Milk sugar is obtained from the milk of mammalia, but 
unlike cane sugar does not ferment. 

Fruit sugar is obtained from sweet fruits, and is sold as 
diabetin^ is sweeter than cane sugar, and is principally used 
by diabetic patients. 



BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 



GUM, PEGTOSE AND CELLULOSE. 

These compounds found in food are closely allied to 
the carbohydrates, but are neither starchy, saccharine, 
nor oily. Gum exists in the juices of almost all plants, 
coming from the stems, branches, and fruits. Examples : 
Gum arable, gum tragacanth, and mucilage. Pectose 
exists in the fleshy pulp of unripe fruit ; during the pro- 
cess of ripening it changes to pectin ; by cooking, pectin 
is changed to pectosic acid, and by longer cooking to 
pectic acid. Pectosic acid is jelly-like when cold; pectic 
acid is jelly-like when hot or cold. Cellulose constitutes 
the cell- walls of vegetable life ; in very young vegetables 
it is possible that it can be acted upon by the digestive 
ferments; in older vegetables it becomes woody and 
completely indigestible. 

FATS AND OILS. 

Fats and oils are found in both the animal and vege- 
table kingdom. Fats are solid ; oils are liquid ; they may 
be converted into a liquid state by application of heat ; 
they contain three substances, stearin (solid), olein 
(liquid), palviitin (semi-solid). Suet is an example where 
stearin is found in excess ; lard where olein is in excess, and 
butter where palmitin is in excess. Margarin is a mixture 
of stearin and palmitin. The fatty acids are fonned of 
stearin, olein, and palmitin, with glycerine as the base. 
Examples: stearic, palmitic, and oleic acid. Butyric 
acid is acid found in butter. These are not sour to the 
taste, but arc called acids on account of their chemical 
composition. 

Among animal fats cream and butter are of first impor- 
tance as foods, on account of their easy assimilation. 
Other examples are : The fat of meats, bone-marrow, suet 
(the best foun,d around the loin and kidneys of the beef 
creature), lard, cottolene, coto-suet, cocoanut butter, but- 
terine and oleomargarine. The principal animal oils are 



MILK. 9 

cod liver oil and oil found in the yolk of egg; principal 
vegetable oils are olive, cotton-seed, poppy, and cocoanut 
oil, and oils obtained from various nuts. 

Oils are divided into two classes, essential and Jioced. Es- 
sential oils are volatile and soluble in alcohol. Examples : 
Clove, rose, nutmeg, and violet. Fixed oils are non-vola- 
tile and soluble in ether, oil or turpentine. Examples : 
Oil of nuts, corn-meal, mustard, and glycerine. 

Fats may be heated to a high temperature, as con- 
sidered in cookery they have no boiling-point. When 
appearing to boil, it is evident water has been added, and 
the temperature lowered to that of boiling water, 212^ F. 

MILK. 

COMPOSITION. 

Proteid, 8.1%. Mineral matter, .7%. 

Fat, 4%. Water, 87%. 

Lactose, 4.9%. 

Boston Chemist. 

The value of milk as a food is obvious from the fact 
that it constitutes the natural food of all young mam- 
malia during the period of their most rapid growth. 
There is some danger, however, of overestimating its 
value in the dietary of adults, as solid food is essential, 
and liquid taken should act as a stimulant and a solvent 
ratlier than as a nutrient. One obtains the greatest 
benefit from milk when taken alone at regular inter- 
vals between meals, or before retiring, and sipped, 
rather than drunk. Hot milk is often given to produce 
sleep. 

When milk is allowed to stand for a few hours, the 
globules of fat, which have been held in suspension 
throughout the liquid, rise to the top in the form of 
cream; this is due to their lower specific gravity. 

The diflPerence in quality of milk depends chiefly on the 
quantity of fat therein : casein, lactose, and mineral mat- 



10 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

ter being nearly constant, water varying but little unless 
milk is adulterated. 

"Why Milk Sours. A germ found floating in the air 
attacks a portion of the lactose in the milk, converting it 
into lactic acid; this, in turn, acts upon the casein (pro- 
teid) and precipitates it, pnxlucing what is known as 
curd and tchet/. AVhey contains water, salts, and some 
sugar. 

Milk is presers'ed by sterilization, pasteurisation, and 
evaporation. Fresh condensed mflk^ a form of evajx)- 
rized milk, is sold in bulk, and is ])referred by many to 
serve with coffee. Various brands of condensed milk and 
cream are on the market in tin cans, hermetically sealed. 
Exam[)les: Xestle's Swiss Condensed Milk, Eagle Con- 
densed Milk, Daisy Condensed Milk, Highland Evapo- 
rated Cream, Borden's Peerless Evaporated Cream.

tracts of malted barley and wheat — is used to a consid- 
erable extent ; it is sold in the form of powder. 

Thin, or straw])erry, and thick cream may l)e obtained 
from almost all creameries. Devonshire, or clotted cream, 
is cream which has been removed from milk allowed to 
heat slowly to a temperature of about 150° F. 

In feedin<i: infants with milk, avoid all danger of infec- 
tious germs by sterilization. By this process milk can l)e 
kej)t for many days, and transported if necessary. To 
prevent acidity of the stomach, add from one to tw'o tea- 
spoonfuls of lime water to each half pint of milk. Lime 
water may be bougiit at any druggist's, or easily prepared 
at liouie. 

Lime Water. Pour two (jiiarts boiling water over an 
inch cube unslacked lime; stir thoroughly and stand over 
night; in the morning pour off the liquid that is clear, and 
bottle for use. Keep in a cool place.

MILK FOR THE SICK. 

It is generally conceded that in typiioid fever and 
diphtheria, milk should constitute the diet in early stages 
of either disease. In cases where it cannot be taken 
alone, it may be taken in combination with soda, seltzer, 
ApolUnaris, or Vichy water, bearing in mind that it 
should be given in small quantities, at fretjuent, regular 
intervals. 

In cases of extreme weakness peptonized milk is often 
used which is partially pre-digested. Koumias (fer- 
mented milk), wliich can be easily prepared at home, 
is much used in fevers and gastric troubles. 

Where a larger amount of nutriment is required, nlbu- 
meiiized milk is valuable. 

Good reports come from the use of modijied milK\ pre- 
pared at the Walker-(4ordon Laboratory, Boston, and 
from a similar laboratory in Philadelphia. Modified milk 
is put up by physicians' prescriptions; the milk is sep- 
arated into its parts, and recombined in different propor- 
tions to better suit the needs of individual cases. The 
milk is always sterilized before it leaves the laboratory. 

BUTTER. 

COMPOSITION. 

Fat, 93% . Mineral matter, M% . 

Water, 5.34 % . Casein, .71 % . 

Pratt Institute, 

Butter of commerce is made from cream of cow's milk. 
The quality depends upon the breed of cow, manner of, 
and care in feeding. Milk from Jersey and (Uiernsey 
cows yields the largest amount of butter. 

Butter should be kept in a cool place, and well covered, 
otherwise it is liable to become rancid; this is due to the 
albuminous constituents of the milk, acting as a ferment, 
setting free the fatty acids. First-quality butter should 



12 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

be usecl ; this does not include pat butter or fancy grades. 
Poor butter has not been as thoroughly worked during 
manufacture, consequently more casein remains; there- 
fore it is more apt to become rancid. Fresh butter spoils 
quickly ; salt acts as a presei^vative. Butter which has 
become rancid by too long keeping may be greatly im- 
proved by melting, heating, and quickly chilling with ice- 
water. The butter will rise to the top, and may be easily 
removed. 

Where butter cannot be affoixled, there are several 
products on the market which have the same chemical 
composition as butter, and are equally wholesome. Ex- 
amples: Butterine and oleomargarine. 

Buttermilk is liquid remaining after butter "has come." 
When taken fresh, it makes a wholesome beverage. 

CHEESE. 

COMPOSITION. 

Proteid, 31.2:5%. Water, 30.17%. 

Fat, 34.39 % . Mineral matter, 4.31 % . 

Cheese is the solid part of sweet milk obtained by heat- 
ing milk and coagulating it by means of rennet or an acid. 
Rennet is an infusion made from prepared inner mem- 
brane of the fourth stomach of the calf. The curd is 
salted and subjected to pressure. Cheese is made from 
skim milk, milk plus cream, or cream. Cheese is kept 
for a longer or shorter time, according to the kind, 
that fermentation or decomposition may take place. 
This is called ripening. Some cream cheeses are not 
allowed to ripen. Milk from Jersey and Guernsey cows 
yields the largest amount of cheese. 

Cheese is very valuable food ; being rich in proteid, it 
may be used as a substitute for meat. A pound of cheese 
is equal in proteid to two pounds of beef. Cheese in the 
raw state is difficult of digestion. This is somewhat over- 
come by cooking and adding a small amount of bicar- 



FRUITS. 13 

bonate of soda. A small piece of rich cheese is often 
eaten to assist digestion. 

The various brands of cheese take their names from 
the places where made. Many foreign ones are now well 
imitated in this country. The favorite kinds of skim-milk 
cheese are: Edam, Gruyere, and Parmesan. Parmesan 
is very hard and used principally for grating. The 
holes in Gruyere are due to aeration. 

The favorite kinds of milk cheese are: Gloucester, 
Cheshire, Cheddar, and Gorgonzola; Milk and cream 
cheese: Stilton and Double Gloucester; Cream cheese: 
Brie, Neufch^tel, and Camembert. 

FRUITS. 

The varieties of fruits consumed are numerous, and 
their uses important. They are chiefly valuable for their 
sugar, acids, and salts, and are cooling, refreshing, and 
stimulating. They act as a tonic, and assist in purifying 
the blood. Many contain a jelly-like substance, called 
pectin, and several contain starch, which daring the 
ripening process is converted into glucose. Bananas, 
dates, figs, prunes, and grapes, owing to their large 
amount of sugar and small amount of water, are the most 
nutritious. Melons, oranges, lemons, and grapes contain 
the largest amount of water. Apples, lemons, and oranges 
are valuable for their potash salts, and oranges and 
lemons especially valuable for their citric acid. It is of 
importance to those who are obliged to exclude much 
sugar from their dietary, to know that plums, peaches, 
apricots, and raspberries have less sugar than other fruits ; 
apples, sweet cherries, grapes, and pears contain the 
lai^est amount. Apples are obtainable nearly all the 
year, and on account of their variety, cheapness, and 
abundance are termed queen of fruits. 

Thoroughly ripe fruits should be freely indulged in, and 
to many are more acceptable than desserts prepared in 
the kitchen. If possible, fruits should always appear on 



14 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

the breakfast-table. In cases where uncooked fruit can- 
not be freely eaten, many kinds may be cooked and prove 
valuable. Never eat unripe fruit, or that which is begiu- 
ning to decay. Fruits should be wiped or rinsed before 
serving. 

VEGETABLE ACIDS. AND WHERE POUND. 
The principal vegetable acids are : 

I. Acetic (IIC2II3O2) , found in wine and vinegar. 

II. Tartaric (II0C4H4O6), found in grapes, pineapples, 
and tamarinds. 

III. Malic, much like tartaric, found in apples, pears, 
peaches, apricots, gooseberries, and currants. 

IV. Citric (HsCoIIgOt), found in lemons, oranges, limes, 
and citron. 

V. Oxalic (H2C0O4), found in rhubarb and sorrel. 

To these may be added tannic acid, obtained from gall 
nuts. Some fruits contain two or more acids. Malic and 
citric are found in strawberries, raspberries, gooseberries, 
and cherries ; malic, citric, and oxalic in cranberries. 

CONDIMENTS. 

Condiments are not classed among foods, but are 
known as food adjuncts. They are used to stimulate the 
appetite by adding flavor to food. Among the moiit im- 
])ortant are salt, spices, and various flavorings. Salt, 
according to some authorities, is called a food, being 
necessary to life. 

Black pepper is ground peppercorns. Peppercorns 
are the dried ])erries of Piper nigrum, grown in the West 
Indies, Sumatra, and other Eastern countries. 

White pepper is made from tiie same berry, the outer 
husk being removed before grinding. It is less irritating 
than black pepper to the coating of the stomach. 



CONDIMENTS. 15 

Cayenne pepper is the powdered pod of capsicum grown 
oil the eastern coast of Africa and in Zanzibar. 

Mustard is the ground seed of two species of the Bras- 
siea. Brassica alba yields white mustard seeds ; Brassica 
nigra, black mustard seeds. Both species are grown in 
Europe and America. 

Ginger is pulverized dried root of Zanzibar officinale, 
grown in Jamaica, China, and India. Commercially speak- 
ing, there are three grades, — Jamaica, best and strongest; 
Cochin, and African. 

Cinnamon is ground inner bark of Chinamomum zey- 
lanicum, principally grown in Ceylon. The cinnamon of 
commerce (cassia) is powdered bark of different species 
of the same shrub, which is principally grown in China, 
and ealleil Chinese cinnamon. It is cheaper than true 
cinnamon. 

Clove is ground flower buds of Caryophyllus aromaticus, 
native to the Moluccas or Spice Islands, but now grown 
principally in Zanzibar, Pemba, and the West Indies. 

Pimento (commonly called allspice) is ground fruit of 
the Eugenia piinenta, grown in Jamaica and the AN'est 
Indies. 

Nutmeg is the kernel of the fruit of the Myristica 
fragrans, grown in Banda Islands. 

Mace. The fibrous network which envelops the nut- 
meg seed constitutes the mace of commerce. 

Vinegar is maxle from apple cider, malt, and wine, and 
is the product of fermentation. It is a great preservative ; 
hence its use in the making of pickles, sauces, and other 
condiments. The amount of acetic acid in vinegar varies 
from two to seven per cent. 

Capers are flower buds of Capparis spinosa, grown in 
countries bordering the Mediterranean. They are pre- 
served in vinegar, and bottled for importation. 

Horse-radiBh is root of Cochliaria armoracia, — a plant 
native to Europe, but now grown in our own country. It 
is generally grated, mixed witii vinegar, and l)ottled.

FLAVORINO EXTRACTS. 

Many flavoring extracts are on the market. Examples : 
Almond, vanilla, lemon, orange, peach, and rose. These 
are made from the flower, fruit, or seed from which they 
are named. Strawberry, pineapple, and banana extracts 
are manufactured from chemicals.

COOKERY. 17 



CHAPTER n. 

COOKERY. 

/^OOKERY is the art of preparing food for the nourish- 
^^ ment of the body. 

Prehistoric man may have lived on uncooked f(X)d8, 
but there are no savage races to-day who do not practice 
cookery in some way, however crude. Progress in civili- 
zation has been accompanied by progress in cookery. 

Much time has been given in the last few years to the 
study^ of foods, their necessary proportions, and manner 
of cooking them. Educators have been shown by scien- 
tists that this knowledge should be disseminated ; as a 
result, "Cookery" is found in the curriculum of public 
schools of many of our towns and cities. 

Food is cooked to develop new flavors, and make it 
more palatable and digestible. For cooking there are 
three essentials (besides the material to be cooked), — 
heat, air, and moisture. 

Heat is molecular motion, and is produced by combus- 
tion. Heat used for cookery is obtained by the combus- 
tion of inflammable substances — wood, coal, charcoal, 
coke, gas, gasoline, kerosene, and alcohol — called fuels. 
Heat for cookery is applied by radiation, conduction, and 
convection. 

Air is composed of oxygen, nitrogen, and argon, and 
surrounds everything. Combustion cannot take place 
without it, the oxygen of the air being the only sup- 
porter of combustion. 

Moisture, in the form of water, either found in the food 
or added to it. 

The combined effect of heat and moisture swells and 
bursts starch-grains ; hardens albumen in eggs, fish, and 

2 



18 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

meat; softens fibrous portions of meat, and cellulose of 
vegetables. 

Among fuels, kerosene oil is the cheapest; gas gives 
the greatest amount of heat in the shortest time. Soft 
wood^ like pine, on account of its coarse fibre, bums 
quickly ; therefore makes the best kindling. Hard wood^ 
like oak and ash, having the fibres closely packed, burns 
slowly, and is used in addition to pine wood for kindling 
coal. Where only wood is used as a fuel, it is principally 
hard wood. 

Charcoal for fuel is produced by the smothered com- 
bustion of wood. It gives an intense, even heat ; there- 
fore makes a good broiling fire. Its use for kindling is 
not infrequent 

There are two kinds of coal: Anthracite^ or hard 
coal. Examples: Hard and free-burning White Ash, 
Shamokiu, and Franklin. Nut is any kind of hard coal 
obtained from screenings. BitnminouSj or soft coal. 
Example: Cannel coal. 

Coke is the solid product of carbonized coal, and bears 
the same relation to coal that charcoal bears to wood. 

Alcohol is employed as fuel when the chafing-dish is 
used. 

FIRE. 

Fire for cookery is confined in a stove or range, so that 
heat may be utilized and regulated. Flame-heat is ob- 
tained from kerosene, gas, or alcohol, a« used in oil- 
stoves, gas-stoves or gas-ranges, and chafing-dishes. 

A cooking-stove is a large iron box set on legs. It 
has a fire-box in the front, the sides of which are lined 
with fire-proof material similar to that of which bricks 
are made. The bottom is furnished with a movable iron 
grate. Underneath the fire-box is a space which extends 
from the grate to a pan for receiving ashes. At the back 
of fire-box is a compartment called the oven, accessible 
on each side of the stove l)y a door. Between the oven 
and the top of the stove is a space for the circulation of air. 



HOW TO BUILD A FIRE. 19 

Stoves are connected with chimney-flues by means of a 
stove-pipe, and have dampers to regulate the supply of 
air and heat, and as an outlet for smoke and gases. 

The damper below the fire-box is known as the front 
damper, by means of which the air supply is regulated, 
thus regulating the heat. 

The oven is heated by a circulation of hot air. This is 
accomplished by closing the oven-damper, which is situ- 
ated near the oven. When this damper is left open, the 
hot air rushes up the chimney. The damper near the 
chimney is known as the chimney 'damper. When open 
it gives a free outlet for the escape of smoke and gas. 
When partially closed, as is usually the case in most 
ranges, except when the fire is started, it ser\'es as a 
saver of heat. There is also a check, which, when open, 
cools the fire and saves heat, but should always be closed 
except when used for this purpose. 

Stoves are but seldom used, portable ranges ha\ing 
taken their places. 

A portable range is a cooking-stove with one door ; it 
often has an under oven, of use for warming dishes and 
keeping food hot. 

A set range is built in a fireplace. It usually has two 
ovens, one on each side of the fire-box, or two above it 
at the back. Set ranges, as they consume so large an 
amount of fuel, are being replaced by portable ones. 

HOW TO BUILD A FIBE. 

Before starting to build a fire, free the grate from 
ashes. To do this, put on covers, close frotit and back 
dampers, and open oven-damper; turn grate, and ashes 
will fall into the ash receiver. If these rules are not fol- 
lowed, ashes will fiy over the room. Turn grate back 
into place, remove the covers over fire-box, and cover 
grate with pieces of paper (twisted in centre and left 
loose at the ends). Cover paper with small sticks, or 
pieces of pine wood, being sure that the wood reaches 



20 BOSTON COOKIXG-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

the ends of fire-box, and so arranged that it will admit 
air. Over pine wood arrange hard wood; then sprinkle 
with two shovelfuls of coal. Put on covers, open closed 
dampers, strike a match, — sufficient friction is formed to 
burn the phospliorus, this in turn lights the sulphur, 
and the sulphur the wood, — then apply the lighted match 
under the grate, and you have a fire. 

Now blacken the stove. Begin at front of range, and 
work towards the back ; as the iron heats, a good polish 
may be obtained. When the wood is thoroughly kindled, 
add more coal. A blue flame will soon appear, which is 
the gas (CO) in the coal burning to carbou deoxide (CO*), 
when the blue flame changes to a white flame; then the 
oven-damper should be closed. In a few moments the 
front damper may be nearly closed, leaving space to ad- 
mit sufficient oxygen to feed the fire. It is sometimes 
forgotten that oxygen is necessary to keep a fire burning. 
As soon as the coal is well ignited, half close the chimney- 
damper, unless the draft be very poor. 

Never allow the fire-box to be more than three-fourths 
filled. When full, the draft is checked, a larger amount 
of fuel is consumed, and much heat is lost. This is 
a point that should be impressed on the mind of the 
cook. 

Ashes must be removed and sifted daily; pick over 
and save good coals, — which are known as cinders, — 
throwing out useless pieces, known as clinkers. 

If a fire is used constantly during the day, replenish 
coal frequently, but in small quantities. If for any length 
of time the fire is not needed, open check, the dampers 
being closed; when again wanted for use, close check, 
open front damper, and with a poker rake out ashes from 
under fire, and wait for fire to burn brightly before adding 
new coal. 

Coal when red hot has parted with most of its heat. 
Some refuse to believe this, and insist upon keeping 
dampers open until most of the heat has escaped into the 
chimney. 



WAYS OP COOKING. 21 

To keep a fire over night, remove the ashes from under 
the fire, put on enougii coal to fill the box, close the 
dampers, and lift the back covers enough to admit air. 
This is better than lifting the covers over the fire-box, 
aad prevents poisonous gases entering the room. 

WAYS OF COOKING. 

The principal ways of cooking are boiling, broiling, 
st-ewing, roasting, baking, frying, sauteing, braising, and 
fricasseeing. 

Boiling is cooking in boiling water. Solid food so 
cooked is called boiled food, though literally this expres- 
sion is incorrect. Examples: Boiled eggs, potatoes, 
mutton, etc. 

Water boOs at 212° F. (sea level), and simmers at 
185° F. Rapidly boiling water has the same tempera- 
ture as slowly boiling water, consequently is able to do 
the same work, — a fact often forgotten by the cook, 
who is too apt "to wood" the fire that water may boil 
vigorously. 

Watery vapor and steam pass off from boiling water. 
St«am is invisible; watery vapor is visible, and is often 
miscalled steam. Cooking utensils commonly used ad- 
mit the escape of watery vapor and steam ; thereby much 
heat is lost if food is cooked in rapidly boiling water. 

Water is boiled for two purposes: First, cooking of 
itself to destroy organic impurities; second, for cooking 
foods. Boiling water toughens and hardens albumen in 
eggs; toughens fibrin and dissolves tissues in meat; 
bursts starch-grains and softens cellulose in cereals and 
vegetables. Milk should never be allowed to boil. At 
boiling temperature (214° F.) the casein is slightly hard- 
ened, and the fat is rendered more difficult of digestion. 
Milk heated over boiling water, as in a double boiler, is 
called scalded milky and reaches a temperature of 11) G° F. 
When foods are cooked over hot water the process is 
called steaming. 



22 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

Stewing is cooking in a small amoant of hot w^ter fo? 
a long time at low temperature ; it is the most economical 
way of cooking meats, as all nutriment is retained, and 
the ordinary way of cooking cheaper cuts. Thus fibre 
and connective tissues are softened, and the whole is 
made tender and palatable. 

Broiling is cooking over or in front of a clear fire. The 
food to be cooked is usually placed in a greased broiler 
or on a gridiron held near the coals, turned often at 
first to sear the outside, — thus preventing escape of inner 
juices, — afterwards turned occasionally. Tender meats 
and fish may be cooked in this way. The flavor obtaine<l 
by broiling is i)articularly fine ; there is, however, a greater 
loss of weight ,in this than in any other way of cooking, 
as the food thus cooked is exposed to free circulation 
of air. When coal is not used, or a fire is not in condi- 
tion for broiling, a plan for pan broiling has been adopted. 
This is done by placing food to be cooked in a hissing hot 
frying-pan, turning often as in broiling. 

Roasting is cooking before a clear fire, with a reflector 
to concentrate the heat. Heat is applied in the same way 
as for broiling, the difference being that the meat for 
roasting is placed on a spit and flowed to revolve, 
thicker pieces always being employed. Tin-kitchens are 
now but seldom used. Meats cooked in a range oven, 
though really baked, are said to be roasted. Meats so 
cooked are pleasing to the sight and agreeable to the 
palate, although, according to Mr. Edward Atkinson, not 
so easily digested as when cooked at a lower temperature 
in the Aladdin oven. 

Baking is cooking in a range oven. 

Frying is cooking by means of immersion in deep fat 
raised to a temperature of 350° to 400° F. For frying 
purposes olive oil, lard, beef drippings, cottolene, coto- 
suet, and cocoanut butter are used. A combination of 
two-thirds lard and one-third beef suet (tried out and 
clarified) is better tJian lard alone. Cottolene, coto-suet, 
and cocoanut butter are economical, inasmuch as they 






WAYS OF COOKING. 23 

may be heated to a high temperature without discoloring, 
therefore may be used for a larger number of fryings. 
Cod fat obtained from beef is often used by chefs for 
frying. 

Great care should be taken in frying that fat is of the 
right temperature ; otherwise food so cooked will absorb 
fat. 

Nearly all foods which do not contain eggs are dipped 
in flour or crumbs, egg, and crumbs, before frying. The 
intense heat of fat hardens the albumen, thus forming a 
coating which prevents food from '* soaking fat." 

When meat or fish is to be fried, it should be kept in a 
warm room for some time previous to cooking, and wiped 
as dry as possible. If cold, it decreases the temperature 
of the fat to such extent that a coating is not formed 
quickly enough to prevent fat from penetrating the food. 
The ebullition of fat is due to water found in food to be 
cooked. 

Great care must be taken that too much is not put into 
the fat at one time, not only because it lowers the tem- 
perature of the fat, but because it causes it to bubble and 
go over the sides of the kettle. It is not fat that boils, 
but water which fat has received from food. 

All fried food on removal from fat should be drained 
on brown paper. 

Rules for Testing Fat for Frying. 1. When the fat 
begins to smoke, drop in an inch cube of bread, from soft 
part of loaf, and if in forty seconds it is golden brown, the 
fat is then of right temperature for frying any cooked 
mixture. 

2. Use same test for uncooked mixtures, allowing one 
minute for bread to brown. 

Many kinds of food may be fried in the same fat ; new 
fat should be used for batter and dough mixtures, pota- 
toes, and fish-balls; after these, fish, meat, and croquettes. 
Fat should be frequently clarified. 

To Clarify Fat. Melt fat, add raw potato cut in quarter- 
inch slices, and allow fat to heat gradually; when fat 



24 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK, 

ceases to bubble and potatoes are well browned, strain 
through double cheese-cloth, placed over wire strainer, 
into a pan. The potato absorbs any odors or gases, and 
collects to itself some of the sediment, remainder settling 
to bottom of kettle. 

When small amount of fat is to be clarified, add to cold 
fat boiling water, stir vigorously, and set aside to cool; 
the fat will form a cake on top, which may be easily re- 
moved; on bottom of the cake will be found sediment, 
which may be readily scraped off with a knife. 

Remnants of fat, either cooked or uncooked, should be 
saved and tried out, and when necessary clarified. 

Fat from beef, poultry, chicken, and pork, may be used 
for shortening or frying purposes; fat from mutton and 
smoked meats may be used for making hai-d and soft 
soap ; fat removed from soup stock, the water in which 
corned beef has been cooked, and drippings from roast 
beef, may be tried out, clarified, and used for shortening 
or frying purposes. 

To Try out Fat. Cut in small pieces and melt in top of 
a double boiler ; in this way it will require less watching 
than if placed in kettle on the back of range. Leaf lard 
is tried out in the same way ; in cutting the leaf, remove 
membrane. After straining lard, that which remains may 
be salted, pressed, and eaten as a relish, and is called 
scraps. 

Saut^ing is frying in a small quantity of fat. Food so 
cooked is much more difficult of digestion than when fried 
in deep fat; it is impossible to cook in this way without 
the food absorbing fat. A frying-pan or griddle is used ; 
the food is cooked on one side, then turned, and cooked 
on the other. 

Braising is stewing and baking (meat). Meat to be 
braised is frequently first sauted to prevent escape of 
much juice in the gravy. The meat is placed in a pan 
with a small (juantity of stock or water, vegetables (car- 
rot, turnip, celery, and onion) cut in pieces, salt, pepper, 
and sweet herbs. The pan should have a tight-fitting 



WAYS OF PREPARING FOOD FOR COOKING. 25 

cover. Meat so prepared should be cooked in an oven at 
low uniform temperature for a long time. This is an 
economical way of cooking, and the only way besides 
stewing or boiling of making a lai"ge piece of tough meat 
palatable and digestible. 

Fricasseeing is sauteing and serving with a sauce. 
Tender meat is fricasseed without previous cooking; less 
tender meat requires cooking in hot water before fricas- 
seeing. Although veal is obtained from a young creature, 
it requires long cooking; it is usually sauted, and then 
cooked in a sauce at low temperature for a long time. 



Various TVays of Preparing Food for Cooking. 

Bgging and Crumbing. Use for crumbing dried bread 
crumbs which have been rolled and sifted, or soft stale 
bread broken in pieces and forced through a colander. 
An ingenious machine on the market, "The Bread 
Ci-umber," does this work. Egg used for crumbing 
should be broken into a shallow plate and beaten with a 
silver fork to blend yolk and white ; dilute each egg with 
two tablespoons water. The crumbs should be taken on 
a board ; food to be fried should be first rolled in crumbs 
(care being tajcen that all parts are covered with crumbs), 
then dipped in egg mixture (equal care being taken to 
cover all parts), then rolled in crumbs again ; after the 
last crumbing remove food to a place on the board where 
there are no crumbs, and shake off some of the outer ones 
which make coating too thick. A broad-bladed knife 
with short handle — the Teller knife — is the most con- 
venient utensil for lifting food to be crumbed from egg 
mixture. Small scallops, oysters, and crabs are more 
easily crumbed by putting crumbs and fish in paper and 
shaking paper until the fish is covered witli cnimbs. The 
object of first crumbing is to dry the surface that egg 
may cling to it; and where a thin coating is desired flour 
is often used in place of crumbs. 



26 BOSTON COOKING-isCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

Larding is introducing small pieces of fat salt pork or 
bacon through the surface of uncooked meat. The flavor 
of lean and dry meat is much improved by larding; ten- 
derloin of beef (fillet), grouse, partridge, pigeon, and 
liver are often prepared in this way. Pig pork being 
firm, is best for larding. Pork should be kept in a cold 
place that it may be well chilled. Remove rind and use 
the part of pork which lies between rind and vein. With 
sharp knife (which is sure to make a clean cut) remove 
slices a little less than one-fourth inch thick; cut the 
slices into strips a little less than one-fourth inch wide ; 
these strips should be two and one-fourth inches long, 
and are called lardoons. Lardoons for small birds — quail, 
for example — should be cut smaller and not quite so long. 
To lard, insert one end of lardoon into larding-needle, 
hold needle firmly, and with pointed end take up a stitch 
one-third inch deep and three- fourths inch wide; draw 
needle through, care being taken that lardoon is left in 
meat and its ends project to equal lengths. Arrange lar- 
doons in parallel rows, one inch apart, stitches in the 
alternate rows being directly underneath each other. 
Lard the upper surface of cuts of meat with the grain, 
never across it. In birds, insert lardoons parallel to 
breast-bone on either side. When large lardoons are 
forced through meat from surface to surface, the process 
is called daubing. Example: Beef k la mode. Thin 
slices of fat salt pork placed over meat may be substi- 
tuted for larding, but flavor is not the same as when 
pork is drawn through flesh, and the dish is far less 
sightly. 

Boning is removing bones from meat or fish, leaving 
the flesh nearly in its original shape. For boning, a 
small sharp knife with pointed blade is essential. Legs 
of mutton and veal and loins of beef may be ordered 
boned at market, no extra charge being made. 

Whoever wishes to learn how to bone should first be 
taught boning of a small bird ; when this is accomplished, 
larger birds, chickens, and turkeys may easily be done,

the processes varying but little. In large birds, tendons 
are drawn from legs, and the wings are left on and 
boned. 

How to Bone a Bird. 

In baying birds for boning, select those which have 
been fresh killed, dry picked and not drawn. Singe, 
remove pinfeathers, head, and feet, and cut off wings 
close to body. Lay bird on a board, breast down. 

Begin at neck and with sharp knife cut through the 
skin the entire length of body. Scrape the flesh from 
backbone until end of one shoulder-blade is found ; scrape 
flesh from shoulder-blade and continue around wing- joint, 
cutting through tendonous portions which are encoun- 
tered; then bone other side. Scrape skin from backbone 
the entire length of body, working across the ribs. Free 
wish-bone and collar-bones, at same time removing crop 
and windpipe; continue down breast-bone, particular 
care being taken not to break the skin as it lies very 
near bone, or to cut the delicate membranes which en- 
close entrails. • Scrape flesh from second joints and 
drumsticks, laying it back and drawing off as a glove 
may be drawn from the hand. Withdraw carcass and 
put flesh back in its origmal shape. In lar^e birds where 
wings are boned, scrape flesh to middle joint, where bone 
should be broken, leaving bone at tip end to assist in 
preserving shape. 

How to Measure. 

Correct measurements are absolutely necessary to in- 
sure the best results. Good judgment, with experience, 
has taught some to measure by sight ; but the majority 
need definite guides. 

Tin measuring-cups, divided in quarters or thirds, hold- 
ing one half-pint, and tea and table spoons of regulation 
sizes, — which may be bought at any store where kitchen 
furnishings are sold, — and a case knife, are essentials 



28

for correct measurement. Mixing-spoons, which are little 
larger than tablespoons, should not be confounded with 
the latter. 




1. Measuring-cup divided in thirds, with tablespoon, illustrating 
the measuring of dry ingredients. 

2. Measuring-cup divided in quarters, with teaspoon one-half full 
of dry ingredients. 

Measuring Ingredients. Flour, meal, powdered and 
confectioners' sugar, and soda should be sifted before 
measuring. Mustard and baking-powder, from standing 
in boxes, settle, therefore should be stirred to lighten; 
salt frequently lumps, and these lumps should be broken. 
A aipfid is measured level. To measure a cupful, put 
in the ingredient by spoonfuls or from a scoop, round 
slightly, and level with a case knife, care being taken 
not to shake the cup. A tablespoonful is measured level. 
A teaspoonful is measured level. 

To measure tea or table spoonfuls, dip the spoon in the 
ingredient, fill, lift, and level with a knife, the sharp edge 
of knife being toward tip of spoon. Divide with knife 
lengthwise of spoon, for a half- spoon ful ; divide halves 
crosswise for quarters, and quarters crosswise for eighths. 
Less than one-eighth of a teaspoonful is considered a few 
grains. 



HOW TO COMBINE INGREDIENTS. 29 

Measuring Liquids. A capful of liquid is all the cup 
will hold. 

A tea or table spoonful is all the spoon will hold. 

Measuring Butter, Lard, etc. To measure butter, lard, 
and other solid fats, pack solidly into cup or spoon, and 
level with a knife. 

When dry ingredients, liquids, and fats are called for 
in the same recipe, measure in the order given, thereby 
using but one cup. 

How to Combine Ingredients. 

Next to measuring comes care in combining, — a fact 
not always recognized by the inexperienced. Three ways 
are considered, — stirring, beating, cutting and folding. 

To stir, mix by using circular motion, widening the 
circles until all is blended. Stirring is the motion ordi- 
narily employed in all cookery, alone or in combination 
with beating. 

To beat, turn ingredient or ingredients over and over, 
continually bringing the under part to the surface, thus 
allowing the utensil used for beating to be constantly 
brought in contact with bottom of the dish and through- 
out the mixture. 

To cut and fold, introduce one ingredient into another 
ingredient or mixture by two motions : with a spoon, a 
repeated vertical downward motion, known as cutting; 
and a turning over and over of mixture, allowing bowl 
of spoon each time to come in contact with bottom of 
dish, is called folding. These repeated motions are alter- 
nated until thorough blending is accomplished. 

By stirring, ingredients are mixed ; by heating^ a large 
amount of air is inclosed ; hy ciUfing and folding, air al- 
ready introduced is prevented from escaping.

"Ways of Preserving. 

1. By Freezing. Foods which spoil readily are frozen 
for transportation, and must be kept packed in ice until 
used. Examples : Fish and poultry. 



i 



WAYS OP PRESERVING. 31 

2. By Refrigeration. Foods so preserved are kept in 
cold storage. The cooling is accomplished by means of 
ice, or by a machine where compressed gas is cooled and 
then permitted to expand. Examples: Meat, milk, but- 
ter, eggs. etc. 

3. By Canning. Which is preserving in air-tight glass 
jars, or tin cans hermetically sealed. When fruit is 
canned, sugar is usually added. 

4. By Sugar. Examples : Fruit-juices and condensed 
milk. 

5. By Ezolnsion of Air. Foods are preserved by ex- 
clusion of air in other ways than canning. Examples: 
Grapes in bran, eggs in lime-water, etc. 

6. By Drying. Drying consists in evaporation of 
nearly all moisture, and is generally with salting, except 
in vegetables and fruits. 

7. By Evaporation. There are examples where con- 
siderable moisture remains, though much is driven ofif. 
Example : Beef extract. 

8. By Salting. There are two kinds of salting, — dry, 
and corning or salting in brine. Examples: Salt cod- 
fish, beef, pork, tripe, etc. 

9. By Smoking. Some foods, after being salted, are 
hung in a closed room for several hours, where hickory 
wood is allowed to smother. Examples : Ham, beef, and 
fish. 

10. By Pickling. Vinegar, to which salt is added, 
and sometimes sugar and spices, is scalded ; and cucum- 
bers, onions, and various kinds of fruit are allowed to 
remain in it. 

11. By Oil. Examples: Sardines, anchovies, etc. 

12. By Antiseptics. The least wholesome way is by 
the use of antiseptics. Borax and salicilic acid, when 
employed, should be used sparingly.

CHAPTER III. 

BEVERAGES. 

A BEVERAGE is any drink. Water is the beverage 
^^ provided for man by Nature. Water is an essen- 
tial to life. All beverages contain a large percentage of 
water, therefore their uses should be considered : — 
1. To quench thirst. 
II. To introduce water into the circulatory system. 

III. To regulate body temperature. 

IV. To assist in carrying off waste. 
V. To nourish. 

VI. To stimulate the nervous system and vanous organs. 
VII. For medicinal purposes. 

Freshly boiled water should be nsed for making hot bev- 
erages ; freshly drawn water for making cold beverages. 

TEA. 

Tea is used by more than one-half the human race; 
and, although the United States is not a tea-drinking 
country, one and one-half pounds are consumed per 
capita per annum. 

All tea is grown from one species of shrub, TViea, the 
leaves of which constitute the tea of commerce. Climate, 
elevation, soil, cultivation, and care in picking and cur- 
ing all go to make up the differences. First-quality^ tea 
is made from young, whole leaves. Two kinds of tea are 
considered : — 

BJavk tea^ made from leaves which have been allowed 
to ferment ])efore curing. 

Green tea, made from unfermented leaves artificially 
colored. 



TEA. 87 

The best black tea comes from India and Ceylon. Some 
familiar brands are Oolong, Foimosa, English Breakfast, 
Orange Pekoe, and Flowery Pekoe. The last two named, 
often employed at the ''five o'clock tea/' command high 
prices ; they are made from the youngest leaves. Orange 
Pekoe is scented with orange leaves. The best green tea 
comes from Japan. Some familiar brands are Hyson, 
Japan, and Gunpowder. 

From analysis, it has been found that tea is rich in 
proteid, but taken as an infusion acts as a stimulant 
rather than as a nutrient. The nutriment is gained 
from sugar and milk ser\^ed with it. The stimulating 
property of tea is due to the alkaloid, theine^ together 
with an essential oil; it contains an astringent, tannin. 
Black tea contains less theine, essential oil, and tannin, 
than green tea. The tannic acid, developed from the 
tannin by infusion, injures the coating of the stomach. 

Although tea is not a substitute for food, it appears so 
for a considerable period of time, as its stimulating effect 
is immediate. It is certain that less food is required 
where much tea is taken, for by its use there is less wear 
of the tissues, consequently less need of repair. When 
taken to excess, it so acts on the nervous system as to 
produce sleeplessness and insomnia, and finally makes a 
complete wreck of its victim. Taken in moderation, it 
acts as a mild stimulant, and ingests a considerable 
amount of water into the system ; it heats the body in 
winter, and cools the body in summer. 

Freshly boiled water should be used for making tea. 
Boiled, because below the boiling-point the stimulating 
property, theine, would not be extracted. Freshly boiled, 
because long cooking renders it flat and insipid to taste 
on account of escape of its atmospheric gases. Tea should 
always be infused, never boiled. Long steeping destroys 
the delicate flavor by developing a larger amount of tan- 
nic acid. 



88 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

How to make Tea. 

3 teaspoons tea. 2 cups boiling water. 

Scald an earthen or china teapot. 

Put in tea, and pour on boiling water. Let stand on 
back of range or in a warm place five minutes. Strain 
and serve immediately, with or without sugar and milk. 
Avoid second steeping of leaves with addition of a few 
fresh ones. If this is done, so lai^e an amount of tannin 
is extracted that various ills are apt to follow. 

Five o'Clook Tea. 

When tea is made in dining or drawing room, a '* Five 
o'clock Teakettle " (Samovar) , and tea-ball or teapot 
are used. 

RusBian Tea. 

Follow recipe for making tea. Russian tea may be 
served hot or cold, but always without milk. A thin slice 
of lemon, from which seeds have been removed, or a few 
drops of lemon- juice, is allowed for each cup. Sugar is 
added according to taste. In Russia a preserved straw- 
berry to each cup is considered an improvement. We 
imitate our Russian friends by garnishing with a candied 
cherry. 

Iced Tea. 

4 teaspoons tea. 2 cups boiling water. 

Follow recipe for making tea. Strain into glasses one- 
third full of cracked ice. Sweeten to taste. The flavor 
is much finer by chilling the infusion quickly. 

COFFEE. 

The coffee-tree is native to Abyssinia, but is now grown 
in all tropical countries. It belongs to the genus Coffea^ 
of which there are about twenty-two species. The seeds 
of berries of coffee-trees constitute the coffee of com- 
merce. Each berry contains two seeds, with exception 



COFFEE. 39 

of maleberry, which is a single round seed. In their 
natural state they are almost tasteless; therefore color, 
shape, and size determine value. Formerly, coffee was 
cured by exposure to the sun; but on account of warm 
climate and sudden rainfalls, coffee was often injured. 
By the new method coffee is washed, and then dried by 
steam heat. 

In coffee plantations, trees are planted in parallel rows, 
from six to eight feet apart, and are pruned so as never 
to exceed six feet in height. Banana-trees are often 
grown in coffee plantations, advantage being taken of 
their outspreading leaves, which protect coffee-trees from 
direct rays of the sun. Brazil produces about two-thiixls 
the coffee used. Central America, Java, and Arabia are 
also coffee centres. 

Tea comes to us ready for use; coffee needs roasting. 
In process of roasting the seeds increase in size, but lose 
fifteen per cent, in weight. Roasting is necessary to de- 
velop the delightful aroma and flavor. Java coffee is 
considered finest. Mocha commands a higher price, owing 
to certain acidity and sparkle, which alone is not desira- 
ble ; but when combined with Java, in proportion of two 
parts Java to one part Mocha, the coffee best suited to 
average taste is made. Some people prefer Maleberry 
Java ; so especial care is taken to have male berries sepa- 
rated, that they may be sold for higher price. Old Gov- 
ernment Java has deservedly gained a good reputation, as 
it is carefully inspected, and its sale controlled by Dutch 
government. Strange as it may seem to the consumer, 
all coffee sold as Java does not come from the island of 
Java. Any coffee, wherever grown, having same charac- 
teristics and flavor, is sold as Java. The same is true of 
other kinds of coffee. 

The stimulating property of coffee is due to the alka- 
loid caffeine, together with an essential oil. Like tea, it 
contains an astringent. Coffee is more stimulating than 
tea, although, weight for weight, tea contains about twice 
as much theine as coffee contains caffnne. The smaller 



40 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

proportion of tea used, accounts for the difference. A 
cup of coffee witli breakfast, and a cup of tea with sup- 
per, serve as a mild stimulant for an adult, and form a 
valuable food adjunct, but should never be found in the 
dietary of a child or dyspeptic. Coffee taken in modera- 
tion quickens action of the heart, acts directly upon the 
nervous system, and assists gastric digestion. Fatigue 
of body and miud are much lessened by moderate use of 
coffee ; severe exposure to cold can be better endured bv 
the coffee drinker. In times of war, coffee has proved 
more valuable than alcoholic stimulants to keep up the 
enduring power of soldiers. Coffee acts as an antidote 
for opium and alcoholic poisoning. Tea and coffee are 
much more readily absorbed when taken on an empty 
stomach; therefore this should be avoided except when 
used for medicinal purposes. Coffee must be taken in 
moderation; its excessive use means palpitation of the 
heart, tremor, insomnia, and nervous prostration. 

Coffee is often adulterated with chiccory, beans, peas, 
and various cereals, which are colored, roasted, and 
ground. By many, a small amount of chiccory is con- 
sidered an improvement, owing to the bitter principle and 
volatile oil which it contains. Chiccory is void of caffeine. 
The addition of chiccory may be detected by adding cold 
water to supposed coffee ; if chiccory is present, the liquid 
will be quickly discolored, and chiccory will sink ; pure 
coffee will float. 

Buying of Coffee. Coffee should be bought for family 
use in small quantities, freshly roasted and ground; or, if 
one has a coffee-mill, it may be ground at home as needed. 
After being ground, unless kept air tight, it quickly dete- 
riorates. If not bought in air-tight cans, with tight-fitting 
cover, or glass jar, it should be emptied into canister as 
soon as brought from grocer's. 

Coffee may be served as filtered coffee, infusion of 
coffee, or decoction of coffee. Commonly speaking, 
boiled coffee is preferred, and is more economical for 



COFFEE. 41 

the consumer. Coffee is ground fine, coarse, and me- 
dium ; and the grinding depends on the way in which it 
is to be made. For filtered coffee have it finely ground ; 
for boiled, coarse or medium. 

Filtered Coffee. 

{French or Percolated.) 
1 cup coffee (finely ground). 6 cups boiling water. 

Various kinds of coffee-pots are on the market for 
making filtered coffee. They all contain a strainer to 
hold coffee without allowing grounds to mix with infu- 
sion. Some have additional vessel to hold boiling water, 
upon which coffee-pot may rest. 

Place coffee in strainer, strainer in coffee-pot, and pot 
on the range. Add gradually boiling water, and allow it 
to filter. Cover between additions of water. If desired 
stronger, re-filter. Serve at once with cut sugar and 
cream. 

Put sugar and cream in cup before hot coffee. There 
will be perceptible difference if cream is added last. If 
cream is not obtainable, scalded milk may be substituted, 
or part milk and part cream may be used, if a diluted cup 
of coffee is desired. 

Boiled Coffee. 

1 cup coffee. 1 cup cold water. 

1 egff. () cups boiling water. 

Scald a granite-ware coffee-pot. Wash eg^^ break, and 
beat slightly. Dilute with one-half the cold water, add 
crushed shell, and mix with coffee. Turn into coffee-pot, 
pour on boiling water, and stir thoroughly. Place on 
front of range, and boil three minutes. If not boiled, 
coffee is cloudj' ; if boiled too long, too much tannic acid 
is developed. The spout of pot should be covered or 
stuffed with soft paper to prevent escape of fragrant 
aroma. Stir and pour some in a cup to be sure that 



42 BOSTON COOKING-%SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

si}out is free from grounds. Return to coffee-pot and 
repeat. Add remaining cold water, which perfects clear- 
ing. Cold water being heavier than hot water sinks to 
the bottom, carrying grounds with it. Place on back of 
range for ten minutes, where coffee will not boil. Serve 
at once. If any is left over, drain from grounds, and 
reserve for making of jelly or other dessert. 

Egg shells may be save<l and used for clearing coffee. 
Three egg shells are sufficient to effect clearing where one 
cup of grovnid coffee is used. The shell performs no 
office in clearing except for the albumen which clings to it. 
Burnett's Crystal Coffee Settler, or salt fith skin, washed, 
dried, and cut in inch pieces j is used for same purpose. 

Coffee made with an egg has a rich flavor which egg 
alone can give. Where strict economy is necessaiy, if 
great care is taken, egg may be omitted. Coffee so made 
should be served from range, as much motion causes it to 
become roiled. 

Tin is an undesirable material for a coffee-pot, as tannic 
acid acts on such metal and is apt to form a poisonous 
compound. 

When coffee and scalded milk are served in equal pro- 
portions, it is called Cafe an ku't. Coffee served with 
whipped cream is called Vienna Coffee. 

To Make a Small Pot of Coffee. Mix one cup ground 
coffee with one egg slightly beaten and crushed shell. To 
one-third of this amount add one-third cup cold water. 
Turn into a scalded coffee-pot, add one pint boiling water, 
and boil three minutes. Let stand on back of range ten 
minutes ; ser\'e. Keep remaining coffee and egg closely 
covered, in a cool place, to use two successive mornings. 

To Make Coffee for One. Allow two tablespoons 
ground coffee to one cup cold water. Add coffee to cold 
water, cover closely, and let stand over night*. In the 
morning bring to boiling point. If carefully poured, a 
clear cup of coffee may be served. 



COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 43 

After-Dinner Coffee. 

(Black Coffee, or Caft( Xoir.) 

For after-dinner coffee use twice the quantity of coffee, 
or half the amount of liquid, given in previous recipcfr.- 
Filtere<l coffee is often preferred where milk or cream is 
not used, as is always the case with black coffee. Serve 
in after-dinner coffee cups, with or without cut sugar. 

After-dinner coffee retards gastric digestion ; but where 
the stomach has been overtaxed by a hearty meal, it may 
prove beneficial, so great are its stimulating effects. 

KOLA. 

Thft preparations on the market made from the kola nut 
have much the same effect upon the system as coffee and 
chocolate, inasmuch as they contain caffeine and theo- 
bromine ; they are also valuable for their diastase and a 
milk-digesting ferment. 

COCOA AND CHOCOLATE. 

The cacao tree ( Theobroma ccteao) is native to Mexico. 
Although successfully cultivated between the twentieth 
parallels of latitude, its industry is chiefly confined to 
Mexico, South America, and the West Indies. Cocoa and 
chocolate are l>oth prepared from seeds of the cocoa bean. 
The bean pod is from seven to ten inches long, and three 
to four and one-half inches in diameter. Each ix>d contains 
from twenty to forty seeds, imbedded in mucilaginous 
material. C<x;oa beans are dried previous to importation. 
Like coffee, they need roasting to develop flavor. After 
roasting, outer covering of bean is removed ; this cover- 
ing makes what is known as cocoa shells^ which have little 
nutritive value. The beans are broken and sold as cocoa 
nibs. 

The various preparations of cocoa on tlie market are 
made from ground cocoa nibs, from which, by means of 
hydraulic pressure, a large amount of fat is expressed,

leaving a solid cake. This in turn is pulverized and 
mixed with sugar, and frequently a small amount of corn- 
starch or arrowroot. To some preparations cinnamon or 
vanilla is added. Broma contains botl\ arrowroot and 
cinnamon. 

Chocolate is made from cocoa nibs, but contains a much 
larger proportion of fat than cocoa ])reparations. Bitter, 
sweet, or flavored chocolate is always sold in cakes. 

The fat obtained from cocoa bean is cocou butter^ which 
gives to cocoa its principal nutrient. 

Cocoa and chocolate differ from tea and coffee inasmuch 
as they contain nutriment as well as stimulant. Theobro- 
mine^ the active principle, is almost identical with theine 
and caffeine in its composition and effects. 

Many people who abstain from the use of tea and coffee 
find cocoa indispensable. Not only is it valuable for its 
own nutriment, but for the lai^e amount of milk added U> 
it. Cocoa may well be placed in the dietary of a child 
after his third year, while chocolate shoidd be avoideil as 
a beverage, but may be given as a confection. Invalids 
and those of weak digestion can take cocoa where choco- 
late would prove too rich. 

Cocoa shells. 

1 cup cocoa shells. 6 cups boiling water.

much more satisfactory drink is obtained. 

Cracked Cocoa. 

}4 cup cracked cocoa. 3 pints boiling water. 

Boil cracked cocoa and water two hours. Strain, and

BREAD AND BKEAD MAKING* 49 



CHAPl'ER IV. 

BBEAD AND BREAD HAKINO. 

T3READ is the most important article of food, and his- 
^ tory tells of its use thousands of years before the 
Christian era. Many processes have been employed in 
making and baking ; and as a result, from the first flat 
cake has come the perfect loaf. The study of bread 
making is of no slight importance, and deserves more 
attention than it receives. 

Considering its great value, it seems unnecessary and 
wrong to find poor bread on the table ; and would that 
our standard might be raised as high as that of our 
friends across the water! Who does not appreciate the 
loaf produced by the French baker, who has worked 
months to learn the art of bread making! 

Bread is made from flour of wheat, or other cereals, by 
addition of water, salt, and a ferment. Wheat flour is 
best adapted for bread making, as it contains gluten in 
the right proportion to make the spongy loaf. But for its 
slight deficiency in fat, wheat bread is a perfect food; 
hence arose the custom of spreading it with butter. It 
should be remembered, in speaking of wheat bread as 
perfect food, that it must be made of entire wheat flour. 
Next to wheat flour ranks rye in importance for bread 
making ; but it is best used in combination with wheat, for 
alone it makes heavy, sticky, moist bread. Corn also 
needs to be used in combination with wheat for bread 
making, for if used alone the bread will be crumbly. 

The miller, in order to produce flour (which will make 
the white loaf, so sightly to many), in the process of grind- 
ing wheat has been forced to remove the inner bran coats, 

4 



50 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

SO rich in mineral matter, and much of the gluten inti- 
mately connected, with them. 

To better understand the details of bread making, 
wheat, from which bread is principally ma<l^ should be 
considered. 

A grain of wheat consists of ( 1 ) an outer covering or 
husk, which is always removed before milling ; (2) bran 
coats, which contain mineral matter ; (3) gluten, the pro- 
teid matter and fat; and (4) starch, the centre and lar- 
gest part of the grain. Wheat is distinguished as white 
and hard^ or red and soft. The former is known as whUer 
wheats having been sown in the fall, and living through 
the w'inter ; the latter is known as spring wheats having 
been sown in the spring. From winter wheat, pastry 
flour, sometimes called St. Louis, is made; from spring 
wheat, bread flour, also called Haxall. St. Lbuis floor 
takes its name from the old process of grinding ; HaxalK 
from the name of the inventor of the new process. All 
flours are now milled by the same process. For difiPerence 
in composition of wheat flours, consult table in Chapter 
VI. on Cereals. 

Wheat is milled for converting into flour by processes 
producing essentially the same results, all requiring 
cleansing, grinding, and bolting. Entire wheat flour has 
only the outer husk removed, the remainder of the kernel 
l)eing finely ground. Graham flour, confounded with 
entire w^heat, is too often found to be an inferior flour, 
mixed witli coarse bran. 

Grinding is accomplished by one of four systems: 
(1) Low milling; (2) Hungarian system, or high milling; 
(3) Roller milling; and (4) By a machine known as 
disintegrator. 

In low milling process, grooved stones are employed 
for grinding. The stones are inclosed in a metal case, 
and provision is made within case for passage of air to 
prevent wheat from becoming overheated. The lower 
stone being permanently fixed, the upper stone being so 
balanced above it that grooves may exactly corre8jx>nd. 



BREAD AND BREAD MAKING. ftl 

when upper stone rotates, sharp edges of grooves meet 
each other, and operate like a pair of scissors. By this 
process flour is made ready for bolting by one grinding. 

In high milling process, grooved stones are employed, 
but are kept so far apart that at first the wheat is only 
bruised, and a series of grindings and sif tings is neces- 
sary. This process is applicable only to the hardest 
wheats, and is partially supplanted by roller-milling. 

In roller milling, wheat is subjected to action of a pair 
of steel or chilled-iron horizontal rollers, having toothed 
surfaces. They revolve in opposite directions, at differ- 
ent rates of speed, and have a cutting action. 

Porcelain rollers, with rough surfaces, are sometimes 
employed. In this system, grinding is accomplished by 
cutting rather than crushing. 

** The disintegrator consists of a pair of circular metal 
disks, set face to face, studded with circles of projecting 
bars so arranged that circles of bars on one disk alternate 
with those of the other. The disks are mounted on the 
same centre, and so closely set to one another that pro- 
jecting bare of one disk come quite close to plane surface 
of the other. They are inclosed within an external casing. 
The disks are caused to rotate in opposite directions with 
great rapidity, and the grain is almost instantaneously 
reduced to a powder." 

After grinding comes bolting, by which process the 
different grades of flour are obtained. The ground wheat 
is placed in octagonal cylinders (covered with silk or linen 
bolting-cloth of different degrees of fineness), which are 
allowed to rotate, thus forcing the wheat through. The 
flour from first sif tings contains the largest percentage of 
gluten. 

Flour is branded under different names to suit man- 
ufacturer or dealer. In consequence, the same wheat, 
milled by the same process, makes flour which is sold 
under different names. 

In buying flour, whether bread or pastry, select the best 
kept by the grocer with whom you trade. Some of the 



52 BOSTON COOKIN(;-Sf^HOOL COOK BOOK. 

well-known brands of bread flour are Swan's Down, Bridal 
Veil, Columbia, Washburn's Kxtra, and Pillsbury's Best; 
of pastry. Best St. Louis. Bread flour should be used 
in all eases where yeast is (.'ailed for, with few excep- 
tions; in other eases, pastry flour. The difference T>e- 
tween bread and pastry flour may be readily detenniued. 
Take bread flour in the hand, close hand tightly', then 
open, and flour will not keep in shape; if allowed to 
pass through fingers it will feel slightly granular. Take 
pastry flour in the hand, close hand tightly, open, and 
flour will be in shape, having impression of the lines of 
the hand, and feeling soft and velvety to touch. Flour 
should always be sifted before measuring. 

Entire wheat flour differs from ordinary flour, inas- 
much as it contains all the gluten found in wheat, the 
outer husk of kernels only being removed, the remainder 
ground to different degrees of fineness and left unbolted. 
Such flours are sold by the different health-food compa- 
nies, who have agencies in the large cities. Franklin 
Mills flour is included in this class. 

Gluten, the proteid of wheat, is a gray, tough, elastic 
substance, insoluble in water. On account of its great 
power of expansion, it holds the gas developed in bread 
dough by fermentation, which otherwise would escape. 

Tesat, 

Yeast is a microscopic plant of fungous growth, and is 
the lowest form of vegetable life. It consists of spores, 
or germs, found floating in air, and belongs to a family 
of which there are many species. These spores grow 
by budding and division, and multiply very rapidly under 
favorable conditions, and produce fermentation. 

Fermentation is the process by which, under influence 
of air, warmth, moisture, and some ferment, sugar (or 
dextrose, starch converted into sugar) is changed into 
alcohol (C2H5IIO) and carbon-dioxide (COa). The prod- 
uct of all fermentation is the same. Three kinds are 



BREAD AND BREAD MAKING. 53 

considered, — alcoholic, acetic, and lactic. Where bread 
dough is allowed to ferment by addition of yeast, the fer- 
mentation is alcoholic ; where alcoholic fermentation con- 
tinues too long, acetic fermentation sets in, which is a 
continuation of alcoholic. Lactic fermentation is fermen- 
tation which takes place when milk sours. 

Liquid, dry or compressed yeast, may be used for rais- 
ing bread. The compressed yeast cakes done up in tin 
foil have long proved satisfactory, and are now almost 
universally used, having replaced the home-made liquid 
yeast. Never use a yeast cake unless perfectly fresh, 
which may be, determined by its light color and absence 
of dark streaks. 

"^The yeast plant is killed at 212° F. ; life is suspended, 
but not entirely destroyed, at 32° F. The temperature 
best suited for its growth is from 65° to 68° F. The most 
favorable conditions for the growth of yeast are a warm, 
moist, sweet, nitrogenous soil. These must be especially 
considered in bread making. 

Bread Making. 

Fermented bread is made by mixing to a dough, flour, 
with a definite quantity of water, milk, or water and 
milk, salt, and a ferment. Sugar is usually added to 
hasten fermentation. Dough is then kneaded that the 
ingredients may be thoroughly incorporated, covered, and 
allowed to rise in a temperature of 68° F. , until dough 
has doubled its bulk. This change has been caused by 
action of the ferment, which attacks some of the starch 
in flour, and changes it to sugar, and sugar in turn to 
alcohol and carbon dioxide, thus lightening the whole 
mass. Dough is then kneaded a second time to break 
bubbles and distribute evenly the carbon dioxide. It is 
shaped in loaves, put in greased bread pans (they being 
half filled), covered, allowed to rise in temperature same 
as for first rising, to double its bulk. If risen too long, 
it will be full of large holes ; if not risen long enough, 



1 



54 BOSTOX COOKIXG-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

it will be heavy and soggy. If pans containing loaves 
are put in too liot a place while rising, a heavy streak 
will be found near ])ottom of loaf. 

How to Shape Loaves and BlBcnits. To shape bread 
dough in loaves, divide dough in parts, each part lai^e 
enough for a loaf, knead until smooth, and if possible 
avoid seams in under part of loaf. Jf baked in brick 
pan, place two loaves in one pan, brushed between with 
a little melted butter. If baked in long shallow pan. 
when well kneaded, roll with both hands to lengthen, 
care being taken that it is smooth and of uniform thickness. 
Where long loaves are baked on sheets, shape and roll 
loosely in a towel sprinkled with corn meal for last 
rising. 

To shape bread dough in biscuits, pull or cut off as 
many small pieces (having them of uniform size) as there 
are to be biscuits. Flour palms of hands slightly ; take up 
each piece and shape separately, lifting, with thumb and 
first two fingers of right hand, and placing in palm of left 
hand, constantly moving dough round and round, while 
folding towards the centre ; when smooth, turn it over and 
roll between palms of hands. Place in greased pans near 
together, brushed between with a little melted butter, 
which will cause biscuits to sei)arate easily after baking. 
For finger rolls, shape biscuits and roll with one hand 
on part of board where there is no flour, until of desired 
length, care being taken to make smooth, of uniform size, 
and round at ends. 

Biscuits may be shaped in a great variety of ways, but 
they should always be small. Large biscuits, though 
equally good, never tempt one by their daintiness. 

Bread is often brushed over with milk before baking, 
to make a darker crust. 

Where bread is allowed to rise over night, a small piece 
of yeast cake must be used ; one-fourth yeast cake to one 
pint liquid is sufficient, one-third yeast cake to one quart 
liquid. Bread mixed and baked during the day requires 



BREAD AND BREAD MAKING. 55 

a larger quantity of yeast ; one yeast cake, or sometimes 
even more, to one pint of liquid. Bread dough mixed with 
a large quantity of yeast should be watched during rising, 
and cut down uls soon as mixture doubles its bulk. If 
proper care is taken, the bread will be found most satis- 
factory, having neither '* yeasty " nor sour taste. 

Fermeuted bread was formerly raised by means of 
leaven. 

Baking of Bread. 

Bread is baked: (1) To kill ferment, (2) to make soluble 
the starch, (8) to drive ofif alcohol and carbon dioxide, 
and (4) to form brown crust of pleasant flavor. Bread 
should be baked in a hot oven. If the oven be too hot 
the crust will brown quickly before the heat has reached 
the centre, and prevent further rising ; loaf should continue 
rising for first fifteen minutes of baking, when it should 
begin to brown, and continue browning for the next tw^enty 
minutes. The last fifteen minutes it should finish baking. 
when the heat may be reduced. When bread is done, it will 
not cling to sides of pan, and may be easily removed. Bis- 
cuits require more heat than loaf bread, should continue ris- 
ing the first five minutes, and begin to brown in eight 
minutes. Experience is the best guide for testing temper- 
ature of oven. Various oven thermometers have been 
made, but none have proved practical. Bread may be 
brushed over with melted butter, three minutes before 
removal from oven, if a more tender crust is desired. 

Care of Bread after Baking. 

Remove loaves at once from pans, and place side down 
on a wire bread or cake cooler. If crisp crust is desired^ 
allow bread to cool without covering ; if soft crust, cover 
with a towel during cooling. When cool, put in tin box 
or stone jar, and cover closely. 

Never keep bread wrapped in cloth, as the cloth will ab- 
sorb moisture and transmit an unpleasant taste to bread. 



56 BOSTOK COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

Bread tins or jars should be washed and scalded twice a 
week in winter, and every other day in summer ; otherwise 
bread is apt to mould. As there are so many ways of 
using small and stale pieces of bread, care should be taken 
that none is wasted. 

Unfermented Bread is raised without a ferment, the 
carbon dioxide being pnxlueed by the use of soda (alkaline 
salt, and an acid). Soiia, employed in combination with 
cream of tartar, for raising mixtures, in proportion of 
one-third soda to two-thirds cream of tartar, was formerly 
used to a great extent, but has been generally superseded 
by baking powder. 

Soda bicarbonate (NallCO a ) is manufactured from 
sodium chloride (NaCl), common salt. 

Baking powder is composed of soda and cream of tar- 
tar in definite, correct proportions, mixed with small quan- 
tity of dry material (flour or corn-starch) to keep action 
from taking place. If found to contain «dum or ammonia, 
it is impure. In using baking powder, allow two teaspoons 
baking powder to each cup of flour, when eggs are not 
used ; to egg mixtures allow one and one-half teaspoons 
baking powder. When a recipe calls for soda and cream 
of tartar, in siil)stituting baking powder use double amount 
of cream of tartar given. 

These rules apply to the various soda and cream of 
tartar baking powders on the market Horsford's Bak- 
ing Powder, the only mineral one, requires one-third less 
than others. 

Soda and cream of tartar, or baking powder mixtures, 
are made light by liberation of gas in mixture ; the gas 
in soda is set free by the acid in cream of tartar ; in order 
to accomplish this, moisture and heat are both required. 
As soon as moisture is added to baking powder mixtures, 
the gas will begin to escape ; hence the necessity of baking 
as soon as possible. If baking powder only is used for 
raising, put mixture to be cooked in a hot oven. 

Cream of tartar (HKC4O6II4) is obtained from argols 
found adhering to bottom and sides of wine casks, which 



BREAD AND BREAD MAKING. 67 

are ninety per cent, cream of tartar. The argols are groand 
and dissolved in boiling water, coloring matter removed 
by filtering through animal charcoal, and by a process of 
recrystallization the cream of tartar of commerce is 
obtained. 

The acid found in molasses, sour milk, and lemon juice, 
will liberate gas in soda, but the action is much (|uicker 
than when cream of tartar is used. 

Fermented and unfermented breads are raised to be 
made light and porous, that they may be easily acted upon 
by the digestive ferments. Some mixtures are made light 
by beating sufficiently to enclose a large amount of air, 
and when baked in a hot oven air is forced to expand. 

Aerated bread is made light by carbon dioxide forced 
into dough under pressure. The carbon dioxide is gener- 
ated from sulphuric acid and lime. Aerated bread is of 
close texture, and has a flavor peculiar to itself. It is a 
product of the baker's skill, but has found little favor 
except in few localities. 

Water Bread. 

2 cups boiling water. l}^ teaspoons salt. 

1 tablespoon butter. )^ yeast cake dissolved in 

1 tablespoon lard. ^ cup lukewarm water. 

1 tablespoon sugar. . 6 cups sifted flour. 

Put butter, lard, sugar, and salt in bread raiser, or 
large bowl without a lip ; pour on boiling water; when luke- 
warm, add dissolved yeast cake and five cups of flour ; then 
stir until thoroughly mixed, using a knife or mixing-spoon. 
Add remaining flour, mix, and turn on a floured board, 
leaving a clean bowl ; knead until mixture is smooth, elas- 
tic to touch, and bubbles may be seen under the surface. 
Some practice is required to knead quickly, but tlie motion 
once acquired will never be forgotten. Return to bowl, 
cover with a clean cloth kept for the purpose, and board 
or tin cover ; let rise over night in temperature of 65° F. 
In morning cut down : this is accomplished by cutting

through and turning over doogh several times with a case 
knife, and cheeks fermentation for a short time; dough 
may be again raised, and recut down if it is not con- 
venient to shape into loaves or biscuits after first cutting. 
When properly cared for, bread need never sour. Toss 
on board slightly floured, knead, shape into loaves or bis- 
cuits, place in greased pans, having pans nearly half full. 
Cover, let rise again to double its bulk, and bake in hot 
oven. (See Baking of Bread and Time Table for Baking.) 
This recipe will make a double loaf of bread and pan of 
biscuit. Cottolene, coto-suet, or beef drippings may be 
used for shortening, one- third less being required. Bread 
shortened with butter has a good flavor, but is not as white 
as when lard is used.

Prepare and bake as Water Bread. Bread may l»e 
mixed, raised, and baked in five hours, by using one yeast 
cake. Bread made in this way has proved most satisfac- 
tory. It is usually mixed in the morning, and the cook is 
able to watch tlie dough while rising and keep it at uni- 
form temperature. It is often desirable to place bowl 
containing dough in pan of water, keeping water at uniform 
temperature of from Do'' to 100° F.

in gem pans. 

Entire "Wheat and Floor Bread. 

Use same ingredients as for Entire Wheat Bread, 
with exception of flour. For flour use three and one-fourth 
cups entire wheat and two and three-fourths cups white

beat thoroughly, turn into buttered bread pans, let rise 
again, and bake. By using one-half cup less flour, the 
dough is better suited for biscuits, but, being soft, is dif- 
ficult to hapdle. To make shaping of biscuits easy, take 
up mixture by spoonfuls, drop into plate 6t flour, and 
have palms of hands well covered with flour before at-

buttered before being placed on mould, and then tied down 
with string; otherwise the bread in rising might force 
off cover. Mould should never be filled more than two- 
thirds full. A melon-mould or one-pound baking- powder 
boxes make the most attractive-shaped loaves, but a five- 
pound lard pail answers the purpose. For steaming, 
place mould on a trivet in kettle containing boiling water, 
allowing water to come half-way up around mould, cover 
closely, and steam, adding, as needed, more boiling water.

add dissolved yeast cake and three cups of flour. Beat 
tlioroughly, cover, and let rise until light ; cut down, and 
add enough flour to knead (it will take about two and 
one-half cups) . Let rise again, toss on slightly floured 
l>oard, knead, pat, and roll out to one-third inch thick- 
ness. Shape with biscuit-cutter, first dipped in flour. 
Dip tbe handle of a case knife in flour, and with it make 
a crease through the middle of each piece; brush over 
one-half of each piece with melted butter, fold, and press 
edges together. Place in gi'eased pan, one inch apart, 
cover, let rise, and bake in hot oven twelve to fifteen min- 
utes. As rolls rise they will part slightly, and if hastened 
in rising are apt to lose their shape.

Bread for Gkuniahing. 

Dry toast is often used for garnishing, cut in various 
shapes. Always shape before toasting. Cubes of bread, 
toast points, and small oblong pieces are most common. 
Cubes of stale bread, from which centres are removed, 
are fried in deep fat and called croiistades; half-inch 
cubes, browned in butter, or fried in deep fat, are called 
crodtons. 

Uaes for Stale Bread. 

All pieces of bread should be saved and utilized. 
Large pieces are best for toast. Soft stale bread, from 
which cnist is removed, when crumbed, is called stale 
bread crumbs, or raspings, and is used for puddings, 
griddle-cakes, omelets, scalloped dishes, and dipping food 
to be fried i Remnants of bread, from which crusts have 
not been removed, are dried in oven, roiled, and sifted. 
These are called dry bread crumbs, and are useful for 
crumbing croquettes, cutlets, fish, meat, etc.

Batters, Sponges, and Doughs. 

BATTER is a mixture of flour and some liquid (usu- 
ally combined with other ingredients, as sugar, salt, 
eggs, etc.), of consistency to pour easily, or to drop from 
a spoon. 

Batters are termed tliiu or thick, according to their 
consistency. 

Sponge is a batter to which yeast is added. 
Dough differs from batter inasmuch as it is stiff enough 
to be handled.

1 tablespoon butter. 

Mix dry ingredients, and sift twice. 

Work in butter and lard with tips of fingers; add 
gradually the liquid, mixing with knife to a soft dough. 
It is impossible to determine the exact amount of liquid, 
owing to differences in flour. Toss on a floured board, 
pat, and roll lightly to one-half inch in thickness. Shape 
with a biscuit-cutter. Place on buttered pan, and bake 
in hot oven twelve to fifteen minutes. If baked in too 
slow an oven, the gas will escape before it has done its

Macaroni, spaghetti J and vermicelli are made from wheaten 
flour, rich in gluten, moistened to a stiff dough with water, 
and forced through small apertures in an iron plate by 
means of a screw press. Various Italian pastes arc made 
from the same mixture. Macaroni is manufactured to

some extent in this country, but the best comes from 
Italy, Lagana and Pejero, being the favorite brand. 
When macaroni is colored, it is done by the use of saf- 
fron, not by eggs, as is generally supposed. The only 
egg macaroni is manufactured in strips, and comes from 
Minneapolis. 

Macaroni is valuable food, as it is very cheap and nu- 
tritious ; but being deficient in fat, it should be combined 
with cream, butter, or cheese, to make a perfect food. 

From cereals many preparations are made, used alone, 
or in combination witli other food products. From rice 
is made rice flour; from oats, oatmeal, and oats steam- 
cooked and rolled, — as Rolled Avena, Quaker Rolled 
Oats, II-O, etc. There are many species of com, the 
principal varieties being wliite, yellow, and red. From 
corn is made corn meal, — both white and yellow, — corn- 
starch, hominy, maizena, cerealine, samp, and hulled 
corn; from wheat, wheateu or white flour,' Wheateua, 
Wheatlet, Wheat Grits, Pettijohns, etc. Rye is princi- 
pally used for meal and flour ; barley, for flour and i^earl 
barley. Buckwheat, throughout the United States, is 
used only when made into flour for buckwheat cakes. 
¦ For family use, cereals should be bought in small 
quantities, and kept in glass jars, tightly covered. Many 
cereal preparations are on the market for making break- 
fast mushes, put up in one and two pound packages, 
with directions for cooking. In nearly all cases, time 
allowed for cooking is not sufficient, unless dish contain- 
ing cereal is brought in direct contact with fire, which is 
not the best way. Mushes should be cooked over hot 
water after the first five minutes; if a double boiler is not 
procurable, improvise one. Boiling water and salt should 
always be added to cereals, allowing one teaspoon salt to 
each cup of cereal, — boiled to soften cellulose and swell 
starch grains, salted to give flavor. Indian meal and 
finely ground preparations should be mixed with cold 
water before adding boiling water, to prevent lumping.

French Chef. 

Pick over rice ; add slowly to boiling, salted water, so as 
not to check boiling of water. Boil thirty minutes, or until 
soft, which may be determined by testing kernels. Old 
rice absorbs much more water than new rice, and takes 
longer for cooking. Drain in coarse strainer, and poor

cooked ; cover, place on back of range, and let stand to 
dry off, when kernels are distinct. When stirring rice, 
always use a fork to avoid breaking kernels.

CHAPTER VII. 
EGGS. 

COMPOSITION. 

Proteid, 14.9%. Mineral matter, 1%. 

Fat, 10.6%. Water, 73.5%. 

TJGGS, like milk, form a typical foot!, inasmuch as they 
^ contain all the elements, in the right proportion, 
necessary for support of the body. Their highly concen- 
trated, nutritive value renders it necessary to use them in 
combination with other foods, rich in starch (bread, pota- 
toes, etc.). In order that the stomach may have enough 
to act upon, a certain amount of bulk must be furnished. 

A pound of eggs (nine) is equivalent in nutritive value 
to a poimd of beef. From this it may be seen that eggs, 
at even twenty-five cents per dozen, should not be freely 
used by the strict economist. Eggs being rich in proteid. 
serve as a valuable substitute for meat. In most fami- 
lies, their use in the making of cake, custard, puddings, 
etc., renders them almost indispensable. It is surprising 
how many intelligent women, who look well to the affain; 
of the kitchen, are satisfied to use what are termed " cook- 
ing eggs ; " this shows poor judgment from an economical 
standpoint. Strictly fresh eggs should always be used, 
if obtainable. An egg after the first twenty-four hours 
steadily deteriorates. If exposed to air, owing to the 
porous structure of the shell, there is an evaporation of 
water, air rushes in, and decomposition takes place. 

White of egg contains albumen in its purest form. Al- 
bumen coagulates at a temperature of from 134° to 160° F. 
Herein lies the importance of cooking eggs at a low tem- 
perature, thus rendering them easy of digestion. £gg8 



EGGS. 93 

cooked in boiling water are tough and horny, difficult of 
digestion, and should never be served. 

When eggs come from the market, they should be 
washed, and put away in a cold place. 

Waya of Determining Freshueaa of Egga. I. Hold in 
front of candle flame in dark room, and the centre should 
look clear. 

II. Place in basin of cold water, and they should sink. 

III. Place large end to the cheek, and a warmth 
should be felt. 

Waya of Keepiog Eggs. I. Pack in sawdust, small 
end down. 

II. Keep in lime water. 

III. From July to September a large number of eggs 
are packed, small ends down, in cases having compart- 
ments, one for each egg, and kept in cold storage. Eggs 
are often kept in cold storage six months, and then sold 
as cooking eggs 

Boiled Eggs. 

Have ready a saucepan containing boiling water. 
Carefully put in with a spoon the number of eggs de- 
sired, covering them with water. Remove saucepan to 
back of range, where water will not boil. Cook from six 
to eight minutes if liked ^' soft boiled," forty to forty-five 
if liked "hard boiled." Eggs may be cooked by placing 
in cold water and allowing water to heat gradually until 
the boiling point is reachecF, when they will be ' ' soft 
boiled." In using hard-boiled eggs for making other 
dishes, when taken from the hot water they should be 
plunged into cold water to prevent, if possible, discolor- 
ation of yolks. 

Eggs perfectly cooked should be placed and kept in 
water at a uniform temperature of 175° F. 

Dropped Eggs (Poached). 

Have ready a shallow pan two-thirds full of boil- 
ing salted water, allowing one-half tablespoon salt to 



94 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

one quart of water. Put two or three buttered muffin 
rings in the water. Break each egg separately into a 
cup, and carefully slip into a muffin ring. The water 
should cover the eggs. When there is a film over the 
top, and the white is firm, carefully remove with a but- 
tered skimmer to circular pieces of buttered toast, and let 
each person season his own egg with butter, salt, and 
pepper. If cooked for an invalid, garnish with four toast- 
points and a bit of parsley. An egg-poacher may be 
used instead of muflftn rings.

fine cracker crum])s. Break an eorg into a cup, and care- 
fully slip into shirrer. Cover with seasoned buttered 
crumbs, and bake in moderate oven until white is firm 
and crumbs brown. The shirrers should be placed on a 
tin plate, that they may be easily removed from the oven. 

Eggs may be baked in small tomatoes. Cut a slice 
from stem end of tomato, scoop out the pulp, slip in an 
egg, sprinkle with salt and pepper, cover with buttered 
crumbs, and bake.

Season to taste with salt, pepper, lemon juice, mustard, 
and cayenne. Shape, and refill whites. 

Omelets. 

For omelets select large eggs, allowing one egg for each 
person, and one tablespoon liquid for each egg. Keep an 
omelet pan especially for omelets, and see that it is kept 
clean and smooth. A frying-pan may be used in place of 
omelet pan. 

Plain Omelet. 

4 eggs. 4 tablespoons hot water, 

1'^ teaspoon salt. 1 tablespoon butter. 

Few grains pepper. l)o cups Thin White Sauce. 

Separate yolks from whites. Beat yolks until thick and 
lemon colored; add salt, pepper, and hot water. Beat 
whites until stiff and dry, cutting and folding them into 
first mixture until they have taken up mixture. Heat 
omelet pan, and bu^tter sides and bottom. Turn in mix- 
ture, spread evenly, place on range where it will cook 
slowly, occasionally turning the pan that omelet maj 
brown evenly. When well '* puffed " and delicately 
browned underneath, place pan on centre grate of oven 
to finish cooking the top. The omelet is cooked if it is 
firm to the touch when pressed by the finger. If it clings 
to the finger like the beaten white of egg, it needs longer 
cooking. Fold and turn on hot platter, and pour around 
one and one-half cups Thin White Sauce. 

Milk is sometimes used in place of hot water, but hot 
w^ater makes a more tender omelet. 

To Fold and Turn an Omelet. 

Hold omelet i)an by handle with the left hand. With 
a case knife make two one-half inch incisions opposite 
each other at right angles to handle. Place knife under 
the part of omelet nearest handle, tip pan to nearly a 
vertical position; by carefully coaxing the omelet with 
knife, it will fold and turn without breaking.

SOUPS. 101 



CHAPTER VIIL 

SOUPS. 

TT cannot be denied that the French excel all nations in 
^ the excellence of their cuisine, and to their soups and 
sauces belong the greatest praise. It would be well to 
follow their example, and it is the duty of every house- 
keeper to learn the art of soup making. How may a 
hearty dinner be better begun than with a thin soup? 
The hot liquid, taken into an empty stomach, is easily 
assimilated, acts as a stimulant rather than as a nutri- 
ent (as is the popular opinion), and prepares the way 
for the meal which is to follow. The cream soups and 
purees are so nutritious that, with bread and butter, they 
furnish a satisfactory meal. 

Soups are divided into two great classes : Soups with 
stock ; soups without stock. 

Soups with stock have, for their basis, beef, veal, mut- 
ton, fish, poultry, or game, separately or in combination. 
They are classified as : — 

Bouillon, made from lean beef, delicately seasoned, and 
usually cleared. Exception, — clam bouillon. 

Brown Soup Stock, made from beef (two-thirds lean 
meat, and remainder bone and fat), highly seasoned with 
vegetables, spices, and sweet herbs. 

White Soup Stock, made from chicken or veal, with 
delicate seasonings. 

Consomm^, usually made from two or three kinds of 
meat (beef, veal, and fowl being employed), highly sea- 
soned with vegetables, spices, and sweet herbs. Always 
served clear. 

Lamb Stock, delicately seasoned, is served as mutton 
broth. 



102 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

Soups without stock are classified as : — 

Cream Soups, made of vegetables or fish, with milk, 
and a small amouut of cream and seasonings. Alwa}'^ 
thickened. 

PurtfoB, made from vegetables or fish, forced through a 
strainer, and retained in soup, milk, and seasonings, 
(renerally thicker than cream soup. Sometimes white 
stock is added. 

Bisques, generally made from shell fish, milk, and sea- 
sonings, and served with fish dice; made similarly to 
[Hir^es. They may be made of meat, game, or vegeta- 
bles, with small dice of the same. 

Various names have been given to soups, according to 
their flavorings, chief ingredients, the peoj)le who use 
them, etc. To the Scotch belongs Scotch Broth ; to the 
French, Pot-au-feu; to the Indo, Mulligatawny; and to 
the Spanish, 011a Podrida. 

SOUP MAKING. 

The art of soup making is more easily mastered than 
at first appears. The young housekeeper is startleil at 
the amazingly large number of ingredients the reei))e 
calls for, and often is discouraged. One may, with but 
little expense, keep at hand what is essential for the 
making of a good soup. Winter vegetables — turnips, 
carrots, celery, and onions — may be bought in large or 
small quantities. The outer stalks of celery, often not 
suitable for serving, should be saved for soups. At sea- 
sons when celery is a luxury, the tips and roots should bt» 
saved and dried. Sweet herbs, including thyme, savorv. 
and marjoram, are dried and put up in packages, retail- 
ing from five to ten cents. Bay leaves, which should k- 
used sparingly, may be obtained at first class grocers' or 
druggists* ; seeming never to lose strength, they may be 
kept indefinitely. Spices, including whole cloves, all- 
spice berries, peppercorns, and stick cinnamon, shonld 
be kept on hand. These seasonings, with the additioo 



SOUPS. 103 

of salt, pepper, and parsley, are the essential flavorings 
for stock soups. Flour, corn-starch, arrowroot, fine tapi- 
oca, sago, pearl barley, rice, bread or eggs are added to 
give consistency and nourishment. 

In small families, where there are few left-overs, fresh 
meat must be bought for the making of soup stock, as a 
good soup cannot be made from a small amount of poor 
material. On the other hand, large families need seldom 
buy fresh meat, providing all left-overs are properly cared 
for. The soup kettle should receive small j)ieees of beef 
(roasted, broiled, or stewed), veal, carcasses of fowl or 
chicken, chop bones, bones left from lamb roast, and all 
trimmings and bones, which a careful housewife should 
see are sent from the market with her order. Avoid the 
use of smoked or corned meats, or lai^e pieces of raw 
mutton or lamb, surrounded by fat, on account of the 
strong flavor so disagreeable to many. A small piece of 
bacon or lean ham is sometimes cooked with vegetables 
for flavor. 

Beef ranks first as regards utility and economy in soup 
making. It should be cut from the fore or hind shin 
(which cuts contain marrow-bone), the middle cuts being 
most desirable. If the lower part of shin is used, tlie 
soup, although rich in gelatin, lacks flavor, unless a cheap 
piece of lean meat is used with it, which frequently is 
done. It must be remembered that meat, bone, and fat 
in the right proportions are all necessary; allow two- 
thirds lean meat, the remaining one-third bone and fat. 
From the meat the soluble juices, salts, extractives (which 
give color and flavor), and a small quantity of gelatin are 
extracted ; from the bone, gelatin (which gives the stock 
when cold a jelly-like consistency) and mineral matter. 
Gelatin is also obtained from cartilage, skin, tendons, and 
ligaments. Some of the fat is absorbed, the remainder 
rises to the top and should be removed. 

Soap-stock making is rendered easier by use of proper 
utensils. Sharp meat knives, hard- wood boanl, two puree 
strainers having meshes of different size, and a soup 



1 



104 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

dige&ter (a porcelain-lined iron pot, having tight-fittlDg 
cover, with valve in the top), or covered granite kettle, 
are essentials. An iron kettle, which formerly constituted 
one of the furnishings of a range, may be used if perfectly 
smooth. A saw, cleaver, and scales, although not neces- 
sary, are useful, and lighten labor. 

When meat comes from market, remove from paper 
and put in cool place. When ready to start stock, if 
scales are at hand, weigh meat and bone to see if correct 
proportions have been sent. Wipe meat with clean cheese 
cloth, wrung out of cold water. Cut lean meat in one- 
inch cubes; by so doing, a large amount of surface 
is exposed to the water, and juices are more easily 
drawn out. Heat frying-pan hissing hot; remove mar- 
row from marrow-bone, and use enough to brown one- 
third of the lean meat, stirring constantly, that all parts 
of surface may be seared, thus preventing escape of 
juices, — sacrificing a certain amount of goodness in the 
stock, to give additional color and flavor, which is ob- 
tained by caramelization. Put fat, bone, and remalniug 
lean meat in soup kettle ; cover with cold water, allowing 
one pint to each pound of meat, bone, and fat. Let stand 
one hour, that cold water may draw out juices from meat. 
Add browned meat, taking water from soup kettle to 
rinse out frying-pan, that none of the coloring may l>e 
lost. Heat gradually to boiling point, and cook six or 
seven hours at low temperature. A scum will rise on the 
top, which contains coagulated albuminous juices; these 
give to soup its chief nutritive value; many, however, 
prefer a clear soup, and have them removed. K allowed 
to remain, when straining, a large part will pass through 
strainer. Vegetables, spices, and salt should be added 
the last hour of cooking. Strain and cool quickly ; by so 
doing stock is less apt to ferment. A knuckle of veal is 
often used for making white soup stock. Fowl should be 
used for stock in preference to chicken, as it is cheaper, 
and contains a larger amount of nutriment. A cake of fat 
forms on stock when cold, which excludes air, and shoold 



SOUPS. 105 

not be removed until stock is used. To remove fat, run 
a knife around edge of bowl and carefully remove the 
same. A small quantity will remain, which should be 
removed by passing a cloth wrung out of hot water around 
edge and over top of stock. This fat should be clarified 
and used for drippings. If time cannot be allowed for 
stock to cool before using, take off as much fat as pos- 
sible with a spoon, and remove the remainder by passing 
tissue or any absorbent paper over the surface. 

How to Clear Soup Stock. 

Whites of eggs slightly beaten, or raw, lean beef finely 
chopped, are employed for clearing soup stock. The al- 
bumen found in each effects the clearing by drawing to 
itself some of the juices which have been extracted from 
the meat, and by action of heat have been coagulated. 
Some rise to the top and form a scum, others are 
precipitated. 

Remove fat from stock, and put quantity to be cleared 
in stew-pan, allowing white and shell of one egg to each 
quart of stock. Beat egg slightly, break shell in small 
pieces and add to stock. Place on front of range, and 
stir constantly until boiling point is reached ; boil two 
minutes. Set back where it may simmer twenty minutes ; 
remove scum, and strain through double thickness of 
cheese cloth placed over a fine strainer. If stock to be 
cleared is not sufi3ciently seasoned, additional seasoning 
must be added as soon as stock has lost its jelly-like con- 
sistency; not after clearing is effected. Many think the 
flavor obtained from a few shavings of lemon rind an 
agreeable addition. 

How^ to Bind Soups. 

Cream soups and purees, if allowed to stand, separate, 
unless bound together. To bind a soup, melt butter, and 
when bubbling add an equal quantity of flour ; when well 
mixed add to boiling soup, stirring constantly. If recipe

calls for more flour than butter, or soup is one that should 
be made in double boiler, add gradually a portion of hot 
mixture to butter and flour until of such consistency that 
it may be poured into the mixture remaining in double 
boiler.

CHAPTER XI. 

FISH. 

'yilE meat of fish is the animal food next in importance 
-¦¦ to that of birds and mammals. Fish meat, with but 
few exceptions, is less stimulating and nouiishing than 
meat of other animals, but is usually easier of digestion. 
Salmon, mackerel, and eels are exceptions to these rules, 
and should not be eaten by those of weak digestion. 
White-blooded fish, on account of their easy digestibil- 
ity, are especially desirable for those of sedentary habits. 
Fish is not recommended for brain-workers on account 
of the large amount of phosphorus (an element abound- 
ing largely in nerve tissue) which it contains, but because 
of its easy digestibility. It is a conceded fact that many 
fish contain less of this element than meat. 

Fish meat is generally considered cheaper than meat 
of other animals. This is true when compared with the 
better cuts of meat, but not so when compared with 
cheaper cuts. 

To obtain from fish its greatest value and flavor, it 
should be eaten fresh, and in season. Turbot, which is 
unproved by keeping, is the only exception to tliis rule. 

To Determine Freshness of Fish* Examine the flesh, 
and it should be firm ; the eyes and gills, and they should 
be bright 

Broiling and baking are best methods for cooking fish. 
White-blooded fish may often be fried, but red-blooded 
rarely. Frozen fish are undesirable ; but if used, should 
be thawed in cold water just before cooking. 

On account of its strong odor, fish should never be put 
in an ice-box with other food, unless closely covered. A 
tin lard pail will be found useful for this purpose.

White and Red Blooded FIbIi. 



1 



White-blooded fish have fat secreted in the liver. Ex- 
amples : Cod, haddock, trout, flounder, smelt, perch, etc 

Red-blooded fish have fat distributed throughout the 
flesh. Examples : Salmon, eels, mackerel, blue-fish, sword- 
fish, shad, herring, etc. 

Cod belongs to one of the most prolific fish families 
(Gadidoe), and is widely distributed throughout the nortb- 
ern and temperate seas of both hemispheres. On account 
of its abundance, cheapness, and easy procurability, it 
forms, from an economical standpoint, one of the most 
important fish foods. Cod have been caught weighing 
over a hundred pounds, but average market cod weigh 
from six to ten pounds ; a six-pound cod measures about 
twenty-three inches in length. Large cod are cut into 
steaks. The skin of cod is white, heavily mottled with 
gray, with a white line running the entire length of fish 
on either side. Cod is cjiught in shallow or deep waters. 
Shallow-water cod (caught off rocks) is called rock cod ; 
deep-water co<l is called off-shore cod. Rock cod are apt 
to be wormy. Cod obtained off Greorge's Banks, New- 
foundland, are called George's cod, and are commercially 
known as the best fish. Quantities of cod are preservetl 
by drying and salting. Salted George's cod is the best 
brand on the market. Cod is in season throughout the 
year. 

Cod Licer Oil is obtained from cods' livers, and has 
great therapeutic value. Isinglass, made from swimming 
bladder of cod, nearly equals in quality that made from 
bladder of sturgeon. 

Haddock is more closely allied to cod than any other 
fish. It is smaller (its average weight being about four 
pounds), and differently mottled. The distinguishing 
mark of the haddock is a black line running the eutiie 
length of fish on either side. Haddock is found in the 
same water and in company with cod, but not so abun- 
dantly. Like cod, haddock is cheap, and in season through- 



i 



FISH. 187 

out the year. Haddock, when di'ied, smoked, and salted, 
is knowu as Finnan Haddie, 

Balibut is the largest of the flatfish family (Pleuro- 
nectidae), specimens having been caught weighing from 
three to four hundred pounds. Small, or chicken, halibut 
is the kind usually found in market, and weighs from fif- 
teen to twenty- five pounds. Halibut are distinctively cold- 
water fish, being caught in water at from 32"^ to 45° F. 
They are found in the North Atlantic and North Pacific 
Oceans, where they are nearly identical. The halibut 
has a compressed body, the skin on one side being white, 
on the other light, or dark gray, and both eyes are found 
on the dark side of head. Halibut is in season through- 
out the year. 

Tnrbot (called little halibut) is a species of the flatfish 
family, being smaller than halibut, and of more delicate 
flavor. Turbot are in season from January to March. 

Flounder is a small fiatfish, which closely resembles 
the sole which is caught in English waters, and is often 
served under that name. 

Trout are generally fresh-water fish, varying much in 
size and skin-coloring. Lake trout, which are the largest, 
reach their greatest perfection in Lakes Huron, Michigan, 
and Superior, but are found in many lakes. Salmon trout 
IS the name applied to trout caught in New York lakes. 
Brook trout, caught in brooks and small lakes, are supe- 
rior eating. Trout are in season from April to August, 
but a few are found later. 

'WhitefiBh is the finest fish found in the Great Lakes. 

Smelts are small salt water fish, and are usually caught 
in temperate waters at the mouths of rivers. New Bruns- 
Tvick and Maine send large quantities of smelts to market. 
Selected smelts are the largest in size, and command 
higher price. The Massachusetts Fish and Game Protec- 
tive Law forbids their sale from March 15th to June Ist. 
Smelts are always sold by the pound. 

Blnefifth belongs to the Pomatomidae family. It is 
widely distributed in temperate waters, taking different 



138 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

names in different localities. In New England and Xhe 
Middle States it is generally called Bluefish, altboogh in 
some parts called Snappers, or Snapping Mackerel. In 
the Sontheru St>ates it is called Greenfish. It is in season 
in our markets from May to October ; as it is frozen and 
kept in cold storage from six to nine months, it may he 
obtained throughout the year. The heavier the fish, the 
better its quality. Bluefish weigh from one to eight poonds^ 
and are from fourteen to twenty-nine inches in length. 

Mackerel is one of the best-known food fishes, and 
is caught in North Atlantic waters. Its skin is lustrous 
dark blue above, with wavy blackish lines, and silvery 
below. It sometimes attains a length of eighteen inches, 
but is usually less. Mackerel weigh from three- fourths 
of a pound to two pounds, and are sold by the piece. 
They are in season from May 1st to September 1st 
Mackerel, when first in market, contain less fat than later 
in the season, therefore are easier of digestion. The 
supply of mackerel varies greatly from year to year, and 
some years is very small. Spanish mackerel are found in 
waters farther south than common mackerel, and in oar 
markets command higher price. 

Salmon live in both fresh and salt waters, always going 
inland, usually to the head of rivers, during the spawn- 
ing season. The young after a time seek salt w^ater, but 
generally return to fresh water. Penobscot River Salmon 
are the best, and come from Maine and St. John, New 
Brunswick. The average weight of salmon is from fifteen 
to twenty-five pounds, and the flesh is of pinkish orange 
color. Salmon are in season from May to September, but 
frozen salmon may be obtained the greater part of the 
year. In the Columbia River and its tributaries salmon 
are so abundant that extensive canneries are built alon^ 
the banks. 

Shad, like salmon, arc found in both salt and fresh 
water, always ascending rivers for spawning. Shad is 
caught on the Atlantic coast of the United States, and its 
capture constitutes one of the most important fisheries. 



I 



SHELLFISH. 139 

Shad have a silveiy hue, which becomes bluish on the back ; 
they vary in length from eighteen to twenty-eight inches, 
and are always sold by the piece, price being irrespective 
of size. Jack shad are usually cheaper than roe shxuL 
The roe of shad is highly esteemed. Shad are in season 
from January to June. First shad in market come from 
Florida, and retail from one and^one-half to two dollars 
each. The finest come from New Brunswick, and appear 
in market about the first of May. 

Caviare is the salted roe of the sturgeon. 

Herring are usually smoked, or smoked and salted, and, 
being very cheap, are a most economical food. 



SHELLFISH. 

I. Bivalve Molluska. 

Oysters are mollusks, having two shells. The shells are 
on the right and left side of the oyster, and are called 
right and left valves. The one upon which the oyster 
rests, grows faster, becomes deeper, and is known as the 
left valve. The valves are fastened by a ligament, which, 
on account of its elasticity, admits of opening and clos- 
ing of the shells. The oyster contains a tough muscle, 
' by which it is attached to the shell ; the body is made uj) 
largely of the liver (which contains glf/cor/en, animal starch), 
and is partially surrounded by fluted layers, which are the 
gills. Natural oyster beds (or banks) are found in shal- 
low salt water having stony bottom, along the entire 
Atlantic coast. The oyster industry of the world is chiefly 
in the United States and France, and on account of its 
increase many artificial beds have been prepared for oyster 
culture. Oysters are five years old before suitable for 
eating. Blue Points, which are small, plump oysters, take 
their name from Bhie Point, Long Island, from which 
place they originally came. Their popularity grew so 
rapidly that the supply became inadequate for the demand, 



140 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

and any small, plump oysters were soon sold for Blue 
Points. During the oyster season they form the first 
course of a dinner, served raw on the half-shell. In oar 
markets, Heleete<l oysters (which are extremely large and 
used for broiling), Providence River, and Norfolk oysters 
are familiarly known, and, taken out of the shells, are sold 
by the quart. Farther aputh, they are sold by count. 

Oysters are obtainable all the year, but are in season 
from September to May. During the summer months 
they are flabby and of poor flavor, although when fresh 
they are perfectly wholesome. Mussels^ eaten in England 
and other parts of Europe, are similar to oysters, though of 
inferior quality. Oysters are nutritious and of easy diges- 
tibility, especially when eaten raw. 

To Open OyMers. Put a thin, flat knife under the back 
end of the right valve, and push forwaixl until it cuts the 
strong muscle which holds the shells together. As soon 
as this is done, the right valve may be raised and sepa- 
rated from the left. 

To Chan Oysters. Put oysters in a strainer placed over 
a bowl. Pour over oysters cold water, allowing one-half 
cuj) water to each quart oysters. Carefully pick over 
oysters, taking each one separately in the fingers, to re- 
move any particles of shell which adhere to tough muscle. 

Clams, among bivalve mollusks, rank in value next to 
oysters. They are found just below the surface of saml 
and mud, above low-water mark, and are easily dug with 
shovel or rake. Clams have hard or soft shells. Soft- 
shell clams are dear to the New Englander. From New 
York to Florida are found hard-shelled clams (quahaugs). 
SmaU qnahaufjs are called Little Neck Clanis and take the 
place of Blue Points at dinner, when Blue Points are out 
of season. 

Scallops are bivalve mollusks, the best being found in 
Long Island Soimd and Narragausett Bay. The central 
muscle forms the edible portion, and is the only part sent 
to market. Scallops are in season from October first to 
April first. 



SHELLFISH, 141 



H. Crustaceans. 

laobsters belong to the highest order of Crustaceans, live 
exclusively in sea-water, generally near rocky coasts, and 
are caught in pots set on gravelly bottoms. The largest 
and best species are found in Atlantic waters from Maino 
to New Jersey, being most abundant on Maine and Massa- 
chusetts coasts. Lobsters have been found weighing from 
sixteen to twenty-five pounds, but such have been exter- 
minated from our coast. The average weight is two 
])Ounds, and the length from ten to fifteen inches. Lob- 
sters are largest and most abundant from June to Septem- 
ber, but are obtainable all the year. Wlien taken from 
the water, shells are of mottled dark green color, excei)t 
when found on sandy bottoms, when they are quite red. 
Lobsters are generally boiled, causing the shell to turn 
red. 

A lobster consists of body, tail, two lai^e claws, and 
four pairs of small claws. On lower side of body, in front 
of targe claws, are various small organs which surround 
the mouth, and a long and short pair of feelers. Under 
the tail are found several pairs of appendages. In the 
female lobster, also called hen lobster, is found, during 
the breeding season, the spawn, known as corah Sex is 
determined by the pair of appendages in the tail which lie 
nearest the body ; in the female they are soft and pliable, 
in the male hard and stiff. At one time small lobsters 
were taken in such quantities that it was feared, if the 
practice was long continued, they would be exterminated. 
To protect the continuance of lobster fislieries, a law has 
been passed in many states prohibiting their sale unless 
at least ten inches long. 

Lobsters shed their shells at irregular intervals, when 
old ones are outgrown. The new ones begin to form and 
take on distinctive characteristics before the old ones are 
discarded. New shells after twenty-four hours' exposure 
to the water are quite hard. 



1 



142 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK- 



Lobsters, being coarse feeders (taking almost any ani- 
mal substance attainable), are difficult of digestion, and 
with some create great gastric disturbance ; notwithstand- 
ing, they are seldom found diseased. 

To Select a Lobster, Take in the hand, and if heavy in 
proportion to its size, the lobster is fresh. Straighten the 
tail, and if it springs into place the lobster was alive (as 
it should have been) when put into tlie pot for boiling. 
There is greater shrinkage in lobsters than in any other 
fish. 

To Open Lobsters, Take off large claws, small claws, 
and separate tail from body. Tail meat may sometimes 
be drawn out whole with a fork ; more often it is neces- 
sary to cut the thin shell portion (using scissors or a can- 
opener) in under part of the tail, then the tail meat may 
always be removed whole. Separate tail meat through 
centre, and remove the small intestinal vein which runs 
its entire length; although generally darker than the 
meat, it is sometimes found of the same color. Hold 
body shell firmly in left hand, and with first two fingers 
and thumb of right hand draw out the body, leaving in 
shell the stomach (known as the lady)^ which is not 
edible, and also some of the green part, the liver. The 
liver may be removed by shaking the shell. The sides 
of the body are covered with the lungs; these are 
always discarded. Break bcKly through the middle and 
separate body bones, picking out meat that lies between 
them, which is some of the sweetest and teuderest to be 
found. Separate large claws at joints. If shells are thin, 
with a knife cut off a strip down the sharp edge, so that 
shell may be broken apart and meat removed whole. 
Where shell is thick, it must be broken with a mallet 
or hammer. Small claws are used for garnishing. The 
shell of body, tail, and lower part of lai^e claws, if not 
broken, may be washed, dried, and used for serving of 
lobster meat after it has been prepared. The portions 
of lobsters which are not edible are lungs^ stomach (lady), 
and intestinal vein. 



SHELLFISH. 148 

Crabs among Crustaceans are next in importance to 
lobsters, commercially speaking. They are about two and 
one-half inches long by five inches wide, and are found 
along the Atlantic coast from Massachusetts to Florida, 
and in the Gulf of Mexico. Crabs, like lobsters, change 
their shells. Soft-shell crabs are those which have re- 
cently shed their old shells, and the new shells have not 
had time to harden ; these are considered by many a great 
luxury. Oyster crabs (very small crabs found in shells 
with oysters), are a delicacy not often indulged in. Crabs 
are in season during the spring and summer. 

Shrimps are found largely in our Southern waters, the 
largest and best coming from Lake Pontchartrain. They 
are about two inches long, covered with a thin shell, and 
are boiled and sent to market with heads removed. Their 
grayish color is changed to pink by boiling. Shrimps are 
in season from May first to October first, and are generally 
used for salads. Canned shrimps are much used and 
favorably known. 

Reptiles. Frogs and terrapin belong to a lower order 
of animals than fish, — reptiles. They are both table deli- 
cacies, and are eaten by the few. 

Only the hind legs of frogs are eaten, and have much 
the same flavor as chicken. 

Terrapin, although sold in our large cities, specially be- 
long to Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, where 
they are cooked and served at their best. They are 
shipped from the South, packed in seaweed, and may be 
kept for some time in a dark place. Terrapin are found 
in both fresh and salt water. The Diamond Back, salt 
water terrapin, coming from Chesapeake Bay, are con- 
sidered the best, and command a very high price. Ter- 
rapin closely resembling Diamond Back, coming from 
Texas and Florida, are principally sold in our markets. 
Terrapin are in season from November to April, but are 
best in January, February, and March. They should 
always be cooked alive.

TO PREPARE FISH FOR COOKING. 

To dean a Pish. Fish are cleaned and dressed at mar- 
ket as ordered, but need additional cleaning before cook- 
ing. Remove scales which have not been taken oflf. This 
is done by drawing a knife over fish, beginning at tail 
and working towards bead, occasionally wiping knife and 
scales from fish. Incline knife slightly towards vou to 
prevent scales from flying. The .largest number of scales 
will be found on the flank. Wipe thoroughly inside 
out with cloth wrung out of cold water, removing 
clotted blood which may be found adhering to backbone* 

Head and tail may or may not be removed, according 
size of fish and manner of cooking. Small fish are g< 
served with head and tail left on. 

To Skin a Fiah. With sharp knife remove fins 
the back and cut off a narrow strip of skin the 
length of back. Loosen skin on one side from bony 
of gills, and being once started, if fish is fresh, it may 
readily drawn off ; if flesh is soft do not work too quicklj, 
as it will be badly torn . By allowing knife to closely fol- 
low skin this may be avoided. After removing skin from 
one side, turn fish and skin the other side. 

To Bone a Fish. Clean and skin before l>oning. Begin- 
ning at the tail, run a sharp knife under flesh close to 
backbone, and with knife follow bone (making as clean t 
cut as possible) its entire length, thus accomplishing the 
removal of one-half the flesh; tui-n and remove 
from other side. Pick out with fingers any small bona 
that may remain. Cod, haddock, halibut, and whitefisfc 
are easily and frequently })one(l; flounders and smelts, 
occasionally. 

To Fillet Fish. Clean, skin, and bone. A piece of fish 
lai^e or small, freed from skin and bones, is known a« « 
fillet. Halibut, cut in three-fourths inch slices, is more 
often cut in fillets than any kind of fish, and fillets are 
frequently rolled. When fiounder is cut in fillets ' is

145 



served under the name of JUlet of sole. Sole found in 
English waters is much esteemed, and flounder is our 
Dearest approach to it. 




To fillet a slice of fish, and to roll and skewer a fillet. 



WAYS OF COOKING FISH. 



To Cook Fish in Boiling Water. Small cod, haddock, 
or cusk are cooked whole in enough boiling water to cover, 
to which is added salt and lemon juice or vinegar. Salt 
^ives flavor ; lemon juice or vinegar keeps the flesh white. 
A long fish-kettle containing a rack on which to place fish 
is useful but rather exjjensive. In place of fish-kettle, if 
the fish is not too large to be coiled in it, a frying-basket 
may be used placed in any kettle. 

Large fish are cut in thick pieces for boiling, containing 
the number of pounds required. Examples : Salmon and 
halibut 

Pieces cut from large fish for boiling should be cleaned 
and tied in a piece of cheese cloth to prevent scum being 
deposited on the fish. If skin is not removed before serv- 

10 



146 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

ing, scald the dark skin and scrape to remove coloriug: 
this may be easily accomplished by holding fish on two 
forks, and lowering into boiling water the part covered 
with black skin ; then remove and scrape. Time required 
for boiling fish depends on extent of surface exposed to 
water. Consult Time Table for Boiling, which will serve 
as a guide. The fish is cooked when flesh leaves the bone, 
no matter how long the time. 

To Broil Fish. Cod, haddock, bluefish, and mackerel 
are split down the back and broiled whole, removing head 
and tail or not, as desired. Salmon, chicken halibut, and 
swordfish are cut in inch slices for broiling. Smelts and 
other small fish are broiled whole, without splitting. Clean 
and wipe fish as dry as possible, sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, and place in well greased wire broiler. Slices of 
fish should be turned often while broiling; whole fish 
should be first broiled on flesh side, then turned and 
broiled on skin side just long enough to make skin brovn 
and crisp. 

To remove from broiler, loosen fish on one side, toni 
and loosen on other side ; otherwise flesh will cling to 
broiler. Slip from broiler to hot platter, or place platter 
over fish and invert platter and broiler together. 

To Bake Fish. Clean, and bake on a greased fish-sheet 
placed in a dripping-pan. If a fish-sheet is not at hand, 
place strips of cotton cloth under fish, by which it may be 
lifted from pan. 

To Fry Fish. Clean fish and wipe as dry as possible. 
Sprinkle with salt, dip in flour or crumbs, egg, and crambs. 
and fry in deep fat. 

To Saut^ Fish. Prepare as for frying, and cook in fry- 
ing-pan with small amount of fat ; or, if preferred, dip in 
granulated corn meal. Cod steak and smelts are often 
cooked in this way.

4 tablespoons oyster liquor. ^ cup melted butter. 

2 tablespoons milk or cream. Salt. 
% cup stale bread crumbs. Pepper. 

Mix bread and cracker crumbs, and stir in butter. Put 
a thin layer in bottom of a buttered shallow baking-dish, 
cover with oysters, and sprinkle with salt and pepper ; add 
one-half each of oyster liquor and cream. Repeat, and

cover top with remaining crumbs. Bake thirty minutes in 
hot oven. Never allow more than two layers of oystere 
for Scalloped Oysters ; if three layers are used, the middle 
layer will be underdone, while others are properly cooked. 
A sprinkling of mace or grated nutmeg to each layer k 
considered by many an improvement. Sherry wine may 
be used in place of cream. 

Sant^d OyBten. 

Clean one pint oysters, sprinkle on both sides with salt 
and pepper. Take up by the tough muscle with plated 
fork and dip in cracker crumbs. Put two tablespoons 
butter in hot frying-pan, add oysters, brown on one side, 
then turn and brown on the other. 

Fried Oysters. 

Clean, and dry between towels, selected oysters. Sea- 
son with salt and pepper, dip in flour, egg, and cracker 
or stale bread crumbs, and fry in deep fat. Drain on 
brown paper and serve on a folded napkin. Garnish with 
parsley and serve with or without Sauce Tyrolienne. 

Fried Oysters in Batter. 

Clean, and dry between towels, selected oysters. Dip 
in batter, fry in deep fat, drain, and serve on a folded 
napkin ; garnish with lemon and parsley. 

Batter. 

2 eggs. J^ teaspoon pepper. 

1 teaspoon salt. 1 cup bread flour. 

X cup milk. 

Beat eggs until light, add salt and pepper. Add milk 
slowly to flour, stir until smooth and well mixed. Combine 
mixtures. 

Little Neck Clams. 

Little Neck Clams are served raw on the half shell, in 
same manner as raw oysters.

Steamed dams. 

Clams for steaming should be bought in the shell and 
always be alive. Wash clams thoroughly, scrubbing witli 
a brush, changing the water several times. Put into a 
large kettle, allowing one-half cup hot water to four quarts 
clams ; cover closely and steam until shells partially open, 
care being taken that they are not overdone. Serve with 
individual dishes of melted butter. Some prefer a few 
drops of lemon juice or vinegar added to the butter. If a 
small quantity of boiling water is put into the dishes, the 
melted butter will float on top and remain hot much longer. 

Roasted Clams. 

Roasted clams are served at Clam Bakes. Clams arc 
washed in sea-water, placed on stones which have been 
previously heated by burning wood on them, ashes re- 
moved, and stones sprinkled with thin layer of seaweed. 
Clams are piled on stones, covered with seaweed, and a 
piece of canvas thrown over them to retain the steam. 

Fried Scallops. 

Clean one quart scallops, add one and one-half cups 
boiling water, and let stand two minutes ; drain, and dry 
between towels. Season with salt and pepper, roll in fine 
cracker crumbs, dip in egg, again in crumbs, and fry two 
minutes in deep fat ; then drain on brown paper. 

Plain Lobster. 

Remove lobster meat from shell, arrange on platter, and 
garnish with small claws. If two lobsters are opened, 
stand tail shells (put together) in centre of platter, and 
arrange meat around them. 

Fried Lobster. 

Remove lobster meat from shell. Use tail meat, divided 
in fourths, and large pieces of claw meat. Sprinkle with

Broiled Live Lobster. 

Live lobsters may be dressed for broiling at market, or 
may be done at home. Clean lobster and place in a bet- 
tered wire broiler. Broil eight minutes on flesh side, turn 
and broil six minutes on shell side. Serve with melted 
butter. Lobsters taste nearly the same when placed Id 
dripping-pan and baked fifteen minutes in hot oven- and 
are much easier cooked. 

To Split a Live Lobster. Cross large claws and hold 
firmly with left hand. With sharp-pointed knife, held in 
right hand, begin at the mouth and make a deep incision,

CHAPTER XIL 



B££F* 



liif SAT is the uame applied to the flesh of all animals 
^^^ used for food. Beef is the meat of steer, ox, or 
cow, and is the most natritious and largely consumed 
of all animal foods. Meat is chiefly composed of the al- 
buminoids (fibrin, albumen, gelatin), fat, mineral matter, 
and water. 

Fibrin is that substance in blood which causes it to 
coagulate when shed. It consists of innumerable delicate 
fibrils which entangle the blood corpuscles, and form with 
them a mass called blood clot Fibrin is insoluble in 
both cold and hot water. 

Albumen is a substance found in the blood and muscle. 
It is soluble in cold water, and is coagulated by hot water 
or heat. It begins to coagulate at 134° F. and becomes 
solid at 160° F. Here lies the necessity of cooking meat 
in hot water at a low temperature ; of broiling meat at a 
high temperature, to quickly sear surface. 

Q«latin in its raw state is termed collagen. It is a 
transparent, tasteless substance, obtained by boiling with 
water, muscle, skin, cartilage, bone, tendon, ligament, or 
membrane of animals. By this process, collagen of con- 
nective tissues is dissolved and converted into gelatin. 
Gelatin is insoluble in cold water, soluble in hot water, 
hut in boiling water is decomposed, and by much boiling 
will not solidify on cooling. When subjected to cold 
water it swells, and is called hydrated gelatin. Myosin 
is the albuminoid of muscle, collagen of tendons, ossein of 
bones, and chondrin of cartilage and gristle. 



170 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK- 

Gelatin, although highly nitrogenous, does not act Id 
the system as other nitrogenous foods, as a large quanti^ 
passes out unchanged. In combination with albumen it 
has a food value. 

Pat is the white or yellowish oily solid substance form- 
ing the chief part of the adipose tissue. Fat is found in 
thick layers directly under the skin, in other parts of the 
body, in bone, and is intermingled throughout the flesh. 
Fat as food is a great heat-giver and force-producer. 6'«ef 
is the name given to fat which lies about the loins and 
kidneys. Beef suet tried out and clarified is muck usd 
in cookery for shortening and frying. 

Mineral Matter. The largest amount of mineral matter 
is found in bone. It is principally calcium phosphate 
(phosphate of lime). Sodium chloride (conunon salt) is 
found in the blood and throughout the tissues. 

"Water abounds in all animals, constituting a large per- 
centage of their weight. 

The color of meat is due to the coloring matter (Iweino- 
globin) which abounds in the red corpuscles of the blood. 

The distinctive flavor of meat is principally due to pep- 
tones and allied substances, and is intensified by the 
presence of sodium chloride and other salts. 

The beef creature is divided by splitting through the 
backbone in two parts, each part being called a side of 
beef. Four hundred and fifty pounds is good market 
weight for a side of beef. 

The most expensive cuts come from that part of the 
creature where muscles are but litle used, which makes the 
meat finer grained and consequently more tender, taking 
less time for cooking. Many of the cheapest cuts, though 
equally nutritious, need long, slow cooking to render them 
tender enough to digest easily. Tough meat which has 
long and coarse fibres is often found to be very juicy, on 
account of the greater motion of that part of the crea- 
ture, which causes the juices to flow freely. Roasting and 
broiling, which develop so fine a flavor, can only be applied 
to the more expensive cuts. The liver, kidneys, and heart

we of firm, close texture, and difficult of digestion. Tripe, 
jrhich is the first stomach of the ox, is easy of digestion, 
l>ut on account of the large amount of fat which it con- 
tains, it is undesirable for those of weak digestion. 




1. First cut of rib. 2. Tip of sirloin. 3. First five ribs. 

The quality of beef depends on age of the creature and 
manner of feeding. The best beef is obtained from a steer 
of four or five years. Good beef should be firm and of 
fine-grained texture, bright red in color, and well mottled 
and coated with fat. The fat should be firm, and of a 
yellowish color. Suet should be dry, and crumble easily. 
Beef should not be eaten as soon as killed, but allowed 
to hang and ripen, — from two to three weeks in winter, 
and two weeks in summer. 

Meat should be removed from paper as soon as it comes 
from market, otherwise paper absorbs some of the juices. 

Meat should be kept in a cool place. In winter, beef 
may be bought in large quantities and cut as needed. If 
one chooses, a loin or rump may be bought and kept by 
the butcher, who sends cuts as ordered. 

Always wipe beef, before cooking, with a cheese cloth 
wrung out of cold water, but never allow it to stand in a 
pan of cold water, as juices will be drawn out.

The Effect of Different Temperatures on the 
Cooking of Meat. 

By putting meat in cold water and allowing water to 
leat gradually, a large amount of juice is extracted and 
neat is tasteless ; and by long cooking the connective 
issues are softened and dissolved, which gives to the 
jtock when cold a jelly-like consistency. This principle 
ipplies to soup-making. 

By putting meat in boiling water, allowing the water to 
)oil for a few minutes, then lowering the temperature, 
iuices in the outer surface are quickly coagulated, and 
the inner juices are prevented from escaping. This prin- 
ciple applies where nutriment and flavor is desired in meat. 
Examples : Boiled mutton, fowl.

Broiled Beefsteak. 

The beat cuts of beef for broiling are, porterho 
sirloin, cross-cut of rump steaks, and second and t 
cuts from top of round. Porterhouse and sirloin 
are the most expensive, on account of the great los 
bone and fat, although price per pound is about the s 
as for cross-cut of rump. Round steak is very juicy, 
having coarser fibre, is not as tender. Steaks shouk 
cut at least an inch thick, and from that to one and

or lean part may be chopped and utilized for meat cal 
fat tried out and clarified for shortening. 

To Broil Steak. Wipe with a cloth wining out of 
water, and trim off superfluous fat. With some of tb< 
grease a wire broiler, place meat in broiler (having 
edge next to handle), and broil over a clear fire, tun 
every ten seconds for the first minute, that surface 
be well seared, thus preventing escape of juices. A 
the first minute, turn occasionally until well cooked 
both sides. Steak cut one inch thick will take 
minutes, if liked rare ; six minutes, if well done. Ren 
to hot platter, spread with butter, and sprinkle with 
and pepper.

roast is desirable for a small family. Back of rump makes 
a superior roast for a lai^e family, and is more ecouomi- 
3ai than sirloin. It is especially desirable where a large 
quantity of dish gravy is liked, for in carving, the meat 
jaices follow the knife. Rib roasts contahi more fat 
than either of the others, and are somewhat cheaper. 

To Roast Beef. Wipe, put on a rac^ in dripping-pan, 
skin side down, rub over with salt, and dredge meat and 
pan with flour. Place in hot oven, that the surface may 
be quickly seared, thus preventing escape of inner juices. 
After flour in pan is browned, reduce heat, and baste 
with fat which has tried out; if meat is quite lean, it may 
be necessary to put trimmings of fat in pan. Baste 
every ten minutes ; if this rule is followed, meat will . be 
found more juicy. When meat is about half done, turn 
it over and dredge with flour, that skin side may be upper- 
most for final browning. For roasting, consult Time Table 
for Baking Meats, page 34. 

If there is danger of flour burning in pan, add a small 
quantity of water; this, however, i? not desirable, and 
seldom need be done if size of pan is adapted to size of 
roast Beef to be well roasted should be started in hot 
oven and heat decreased, so that when carved the slices 
will be red throughout, with a crisp layer of golden brown 
fat on the top. Beef roasted when temperature is so 
high that surface is hardened before heat can penetrate to 
the centre is most unsatisfactory. 

Sirloin or rib roasts may have the bones removed, and 
be rolled, skewered, and tied in shape. Chicago Butt is 
cut from the most tender part of back of ramp. They 
are shipped from Chicago, our greatest beef centre, and 
if fresh and from a heavy creature, make excellent roasts 
at a small price. 

Roast Beef Gravy. Remove some of the fat from pan, 
leaving three tablespoonfuls. Place on front of range, 
add three tablespoons flour, and stir until well browned. 
The flour, dredged and browned in pan, should give 
additional color to gravy. Add gradually one and one-

Larded FUlet of Beef. 

The tend* rloin of beef which lies under the loin 
rump is called lillet of beef. The fillet under the k 
known as tlie long fillet, and when removed no pc 
house steaks can be cut ; therefore it commands a hi 
price than t[ie short fillet lying under rump. Two i 
fillets are often skewered together, and served in pla 
a long fillet.

surface in pork fat. When turning meat, avoid piercing 
with fork or skewer, which allows the inner juices to 
escape. Place on trivet in deep granite pan or in earthen 
pudding-dish, and surround with vegetables, peppercorns, 
and three cups boiling water ; cover closely, and bake four 
hours in very slow oven, basting every half-hour, and 
turn after second hour. Throughout the cooking, tlie 
liquid should be kept below the boiling point Serve

(with exception of lardoons and vegetables), and owri

remaining fat, and bone sawed in pieces; cover with boil- 
ing water and boil five minutes, then cook at a lower 
temperature until meat is tender (time required being 
about three hours). Add carrot, turnip, and onion, with 
salt and pepper the last hour of cooking. Parboil pota- 
toes five minutes, and add to stew fifteen minutes before 
taking from fire. Remove bones, large pieces of fat, and 
then skim. Thicken with one-fourth cup flour, diluted 
with enough cold water to pour easily. Pour in deep hot 
platter, and surround with dumplings. Remnants of roast 
beef are usually made into a beef stew ; the meat having 
been once cooked, there is no necessity of browning it. 
If gravy is left, it should be added to the stew. 

Corned Beef. 

Corned beef has but little nutritive value. It is used 
to give variety to our diet in summer, when fresh meats 
prove too stimulating. It is eaten by the workingman 
to give bulk to his food. The best pieces of corned beef 
are the rattle rand and fancy bri^tket. The fancy brisket 
commands a higher price and may be easily told from the 
rattle rand by the selvage on lower side and the absence 
of bones. The upper end of brisket (butt end) is thick 
and composed mostly of lean meat, the middle cut has 
more fat but is not well mixed, while the lower (navel 
end) has a lai^e quantity of fat. The rattle rand contains 
a thick lean end ; the second cut contains three distinct 
layers of meat and fat, and is considered the best cut 
by those who prefer meat well streaked with fat. The 
rattle rand has a thin end, which contains but one layer of 
lean meat and much fat, consequently is not a desirable 
piece. 

To Boil Corned Beef. Wipe the meat and tie securely 
in shape, if this has not been already done at market. 
Put in kettle, cover with cold water, and bring slowly to 
boiling point. Boil five minutes, remove scum, and cook 
at a lower temperature until tender. Cool slightly in

and place on cover a weight, that meat may be w<

put in alternate layers in a bread pan, then covered ai

Boiled Dinner. 

A boiled dinner consists of warm unpressed com 
beef, served with cabbage, beets, turnips, carrots, a 
potatoes. After removing meat from water, skim off 1 
and cook vegetables (with exception of beets, which i 
quire a long time for cooking) in this water. Carn 
require a longer time for cooking than cabbage or ti 
nips. Carrots and turnips, if small, may be coot 
whole; if large, cut in pieces. Cabbage and beets i 
served in separate dishes, other vegetables on same d 
with meat. 

Boiled Tongue. 

A boiled corned tongue is cooked the same as Boi 
Corned Beef. If very salt, it should be soaked in c 
water several hours, or over night, before cooking. Ti 
from water when slightly cx)oled and remove skin. 

Braised Tongue. 

A fresh tongue is necessary for braising. Put tonj 
in kettle, cover wdth boiling w^ater, and cook slowly 1 
hours. Take tongue from water and remove skin s 
roots. Place in deep pan and surround with one-tl: 
cup each carrot, onion, and celery, cut in dice, and <

closely, and bake two hours, turning after the first he

CHAPTER Xin. 

LAMB AND MTJTTOK. 

T AMB is the name given to the meat of lambs ; ma 
-^ to the meat of sheep. Lamb, coming as it does 
the young creature, is immature, and less nutritious 
mutton. The flesh of mutton ranks with the flesh of 
in nutritive value and digestibility. The fat of mu 
on account of its larger percentage of stearic acid, is 
difficult of digestion than the fat of beef. 

Lamb may be eaten soon after the animal is killed 
dressed ; mutton must hang to ripen. Grood mutton c 
from a sheep about three 3'ears old, and should hang 
two to three weeks. The English South Down Mutt 
cut from creatures even older than three years. Y 
lamb, when killed from six weeks to three months o 
called spring lamb, and appeal's in the market as eai 
the last of January, but is very scarce until March. ] 
one year old is called a yearling. Many object U 
strong flavor of mutton ; this is greatly overcome t 
moving the pink skin and trimming off superfluous fa 

Lamb and mutton are divided into two parts by cu 
through entire length of backbone ; then subdi^'idec] 
fore and hind quarter, eight ribs being left on hind-< 
ter, — while in beef but three ribs are left on hind-quj 
These eight ribs are cut into chops and are known s 
chops. The meat which lies between these ribs an< 
leg, cut into chops, is known as loin or kidney cfiops. 

Lamb and mutton chops cut from loin have a small 
of tenderloin on one side of bone, and correspond to pc 
house steaks in tlie beef creature. Rib chops which

the bone cut short and scraped clean, nearly to the lean 
meat, are called French chops. 

TJie leg is sold whole for boiling or roasting. The fore- 
quarter may be boned, stuffed, rolled, and roasted, but is 
more often used for broth, stew, or fricassee. 

For a saddle of mutton the loin is removed whole before 
splitting the creature. Some of bones are removed and

the flank en<U are rolled, fasteued with wooden skc 
ami i^H-urelv tied to keep skewers in place. 

Good ([uality mutton should be fine-grained ai 
bright pink i olor ; the fat white, hard, and flaky. 1 
ont«jde rtkin comes off easily, mutton is sure to be

vho\My by tlii' red color of bone. As lamb grows < 
bltxKi recL^dc'Si from bones ; therefore in mutton the b

in le^ of mutton the bone at joint is smooth and rou 
Gorxl nmttoit I'on tains a larger proijortion of fat than 
beef* Poor mutton is often told by the relatively 
proportion of fat and lean as compared to bone. 

Lamb is unuaUy preferred well done ; mutton is 
cooked rare. 

Broiled Lamb or Mutton Chops. 

Wipe rho[is, remove superfluous fat,, and place 
broiler jLtreastid with some of mutton fat. In loin c

Roll in flour, dip in egg, then in stale bread crumbs, and 
saut^ in butter eight minutes, turning often. Place in 
oven four minutes to finish cooking. Arrange on hot 
platter for serving, and place on top of each a fresh 
broiled mushroom or mushroom baked in cream. To fat 
in pan add small quantity of boiling water and pour around 
chops. This is a delicious way of cooking chops for a

VEAL. 

'ITElAIi is the meat obtained from a young calf killed 
^ when six to eight weeks old. Veal from a younger 
animal is very unwholesome, and is liable to provoke mv\- 
OQs gastric disturbances. Veal contains a much smaller 
percentage of fat than beef or mutton, is leys nutri- 
tioTis and (though from a young creature) more diflk'ultof 
digestion. Like lamb, it is not improved by long hang-

ing, but Bhould be soon eaten after killing and dr*^s3- 
ing. It should always be remembered that the flesh of 
young animals does not keep fresh as long as that of older 
ones. Veal is divided in same manner as laml>i into fore 
and hind quarters. The fore-quarter is sulidivided into 
breast, shoulden and neck; the hind-quarter into loin, 
leg, and knuckle- Cutlets, fillets (cushion), and fric andean 
are cut from the thick part of leg. 

Good veal may be known by its pinkish-colored flesh 
and whit-c fat; when the flesh lacks color, it has been 
taken from a creature which was too young to kill for

CHAPTER XV. 

SWEETBREADS. 

A SWEETBREAD is the thymus gland of lamb or ea 
^^ but in cookery, veal sweetbreads only are eo»s 
ered. It is prenatally developed, of unknown funcii< 
and as soon as calf is taken from liquid food it grai^uj 
disappears. Pancreas, stomach sweetbread, is sold 
some sections of the country, but in our markets this c 
tom is not practised. Sweetbreads are a reputed U 
delicacy, and a valuable addition to the menu of 
convalescent. 

A sweetbread consists of two parts, connected by tal 
and membranes. The round, compact part is called 
heart sweetbread, as its position is nearer the heart ; 
other part is called the throat sweetbread. When sw 
bread is found in market separated, avoid buying tw< 
the throat sweetbreads, as the heart sweetbread is n 
desirable. 

Sweetbreads spoil very quickly. They should be 
moved from paper as soon as received from mar 
plunged into cold water and allowed to stand one h 
drained, and put into acidulated, salted boiling ws 
then allowed to cook slowly twenty minutes; a^ 
drained, and plunged into cold water, that they ma 
kept white and firm. Sweetbreads are always parlx 
in this manner for subsequent cooking.

CHAPTER XVn. 



POULTRY AND GAME. 



jOULTRY includes all domestic birds suitable for food 
except pigeon and squab. Examples: Chicken, 
rl, turkey, duck, goose, etc. Game includes such birds 
I animals suitable for food as are pursued and taken 
field and forest. Examples: Quail, partridge, wild 
jk, plover, deer, etc. 

rhe flesh of chicken, fowl, and turkey has much shorter 
¦e than that of ruminating animals, and is not inter- 
igled with fat, — the fat always being found in layers 
ectly under the skin, and surrounding the intestines, 
icken, fowl, and turkey are nutritious, and chicken is 
icially easy of digestion. The white meat found on 
ast and wing is more readily digested than the dark 
at. The legs, on account of constant motion, are of 
oarser fibre and darker color. 

Mnce incubators have been so much used for hatching 
ckens, small birds suitable for broiling may be always 
md in market. Chickens which appear in market dur- 
January weighing about one and one-half pounds are 
led spring chickens,

best from March until June. 

Philadelphia, until recently, furnished our market with 
iladelphia chickens and capons^ but now Massachusetts 
nishes equally good ones, which are found in market 
m December to June. They are very large, plump,

Fresh quail are in market from October fifteenth to 
Quary first, the law forbidding their being killed at any 
ler time in the year. The same is true of partridge ; 
b both are frozen and kept in cold storage several 
>nth8. California sends frozen quail in large numbei*8 

Eastern markets. Grouse (prairie chicken) are al- 
ys obtainable, — fresh ones in the fall ; later, those kept 
cold storage. Plover may be bought from April until 
member. 

Fo Select Poultry and Gkune. A chicken is known by 
't feet, smooth skin, and soft cartilage at end of breast- 
ae. An abundance of pinfeathers always indicates a 
ang bird, while the presence of long hairs denotes age. 
a fowl the feet have become hard and dry with coarse 
lies, and cartilage at end of breastbone has ossified. 
>ck turkeys are usually better eating than hen turkeys, 
less hen turkey is young, small, and plump. A good 
key should be plump, have smooth dark legs, and 
rtilage at end of breastbone soft and pliable. Good 
58e abound in pinfeathers. Small birds should be 
imp, have soft feet and pliable bills. 
Po Dress and Clean Poultry. Remove hairs and down by 
Iding the bird over a flame (from gas, alcohol, or burn- 
\ paper) and constantly changing position until all 
rts of surface have been exposed to flame ; this is known 

singeing. Cut off the head and draw out pinfeathers, 
ing a small pointed knife. Cut through the skin around 
J l^ one and one-half inches below the leg joint, care 
ing taken not to cut tendons ; place leg at this cut over 
^e of board, press downward to snap the bone, then 
ce foot in right hand, holding bird firmly in left hand, 
i pull off foot, and with it the tendons. In old birds 
; tendons must be drawn separately, which is best ac- 
mplished by using a steel skewer. Make an incision 
•ough skin below breastbone, just large enough to ad- 
t the hand. With the hand remove entrails, gizzard,

VEGETABLES. 251 

nth exception of beans, peas, and lentils, which contain 
large amount of proteid, they are chiefly valuable for 

heir potash salts, and should form a part of each day's 

Lietary. Many contain much cellulose, which gives needed 

»ulk to the food. The legumes, peas, beans, and lentils 

nay be used in place of flesh food. 
For the various vegetables different parts of the plant 

ure used. Some are eaten in the natural state, others are 

iKX>ked. 

Tubers. White poUitoea and Jerusalem artichokes. 
^^^^ J Beetij, carrots, pai-suips, radishes, sweet [wtatoes, 

( salsify or oyster plant, and turnips. 
Bulbs. Garlic, onions, and .shallots. 
Stems. Asparagus, celery, and chives. 
w < Brussels sprouts, beet greens, cabbages, dande- 

I lions, lettuce, sorrel, spinach, and watercress. 
Flowers. Cauliflower. 
Fr "t i ^^^^9 corn, cucumbers, okra, egg-plant, peas, 

( lentils, squash, and tomatoes. 

Young, tender vegetables, — as lettuce, radishes, cucum- 
bers; water-cress, and tomatoes, — eaten uncooked, served 
separately or combined in salads, help to stimulate a flag- 
ging appetite, and when dressed with oil furnish consid- 
erable nutriment. 

Beans, and peas when old, should be employed in mak- 
ing purees and soups; by so doing, the outer covering of 
ceWnlose, so irritating to the stomach, is removed. 

Care of Vegetables. 

Summer vegetables should be cooked as soon after 
gathering as possible ; in case they must be kept, spread 
on bottom of cool, dry, well-ventilated cellar, or place in 
ice-box. Lettuce may be best kept by sprinkling with 
cold water and placing in a tin pail closely covered, 
lilted vegetables may be freshened by allowing to stand 
in cold water. Vegetables which contain sugar lose some 
^t their sweetness by standing ; corn and peas are more 



252 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK, 

quickly affected than others. Winter vegetables sbodd 
be kept in a cold, dry place. Beets, caiTots, turoiis, 
potatoes, etc. , should be put in barrels or piled in Ihib, 
to exclude as much air as possible. Squash should he 
spread, and needs careful watching; when dark spoft 
appear, cook at once. 

In using canned goods, empty contents from can » | 
soon as opened, lest the acid therein act on the tin to |flo- i 
duce poisonous compounds, and let stand one hoar, thsX'i \ 
may become reoxygenated. Beans, peas, asparagus, eto- 
should be emptied into a strainer, drained, and cold wate- \ 
poured over them and allowed to run through. In usiDf | 
dried vegetables, soak in cold water several hours befor? , 
cooking. A few years ago native vegetables were alone 
sold ; but now our markets are largely supplied from thr 
Southern States and California, thus allowing us fre^ 
vegetables throughout the year. 

I 
Cooking of Vegetables. i 

A small scrubbing-brush, which may be bought for fi^f 
cents, and two small pointed knives for preparing veg^ 
tables should ])e found in every kitchen. 

Vegetables should be washed in cold water, and cooked 
until soft in boiling salted water; if cooked in an udcot- 
ered vessel, their color is better kept. For peas and bea»' 
add salt to water last half hour of cooking. Time for 
cooking the same vegetable varies according to fresliDes* ^ 
and age, therefore time-tables for cooking serve onlyi^* 
guides. 

Mushrooms and Truffles. 

These are classed among vegetables. MushrooniN 
which grow about us abundantly, may be easily gath- 
ered, and as they contain considerable nutriment, should \ 
often be found on the table. While there are handled? \ 
of varieties, one by a little study may acquaint herself 
with a dozen or more of the most common ones which 



VEGETABLES. 253 

d valuable as food. Consult W. Hamilton Gibson, 
Our £dible Toadstools and Mushrooms." Many might 
use illness, bat only a few varieties of the Amanita 
mily are deadly poison. Mushrooms require heat and 
oisture, — a severe drought or very wet soil being un- 
ivorable for their growth. Never gather mushrooms in 
le vicinity of decaying matter. They appear the middle 
f May, and last until frost comes. Campestris is the va- 
ety always found in market ; French canned are of this 
unily. Boleti are dried, canned, and sold as cepes. 

Truffles. 

Truffles belong to the same family as mushrooms, and 
tfe grown underground. France is the most famous field 
'or their production, from which country they are exported 
n Ian. cans, and are too expensive for ordinary use. 



Artichokes. 

French artichokes, imported throughout the year, are the 
ones principally used. They retail from thirty to forty 
cents each, and are cheapest and best in November, De- 
cember, and January. Jerusalem artichokes are employed 
for pickling, and can be bought for fifteen cents per 
quart 

Boiled Artichokes. 

Cut off stem close to leaves, remove outside bottom 
^fc&ves, trim artichoke, cut off one inch from top of leaves, 
*nd with a sharp knife remove choke ; then tie artichoke 
^th a string to keep its shape. Soak one-half hour in 
cold water. Drain, and cook thirty to forty-five minutes 
in boiling, salted, acidulated water. Remove from water, 
place upside down to drain, then take off string. Serve 
^th Bechamel or Hollandaise Sauce. Boiled Artichokes 
often constitute a course at dinner. Leaves are drawn 
ont separately with fingers, dipped in sauce, and fleshy ends

and pour around them Thin White Sauce. 

Asparagus. 

Hothouse asparagus is found in market during winter, 
but is not very satisfactory, and is sold for abont one 
dollar per bunch. Oyster Bay (white asparagus) appear 
first of May, and commands a very high price. Large and 
small green stalk asparagus is in season from first of jMf 
to middle of July, and cheapest the middle of June. 

Boiled Asparagus.

VEGETABLES. 266 

leaving tips out of water first ten minutes. Drain, remove 
string, and spread with soft butter, allowing one and one- 
[lalf tablespoons butter to each bunch asparagus. Aspar- 
agus is often broken in inch pieces for boiling, cooking 
tips a shorter time than stalks. 

Asparagus on Toast. 
Serve Boiled Asparagus on Buttered or Milk Toast. 

Asparagus in WMte Sauce. 

Boil asparagus cut in one-inch pieces, drain, and add to 
White Sauce I., allowing one cup sauce to each bunch

California ; natives appear in market the last of June and 
continue until the last of September. There are two 
varieties, green (pole cranberry being best flavored) and 
yellow (butter bean). 

Shell Beans^ including horticultural and sieva, are sold

vahiable during the winter and spring, when other green 
vegetables in market command a high price. Although 



1

containing but little nutriment, it is useful for the laige 
quantity of water and potash salts that it contains, and 
assists in stimulating the appetite. Curly lettuce is of ie^ 
value than Tennis Ball, but makes an effective ganiish. 

Lettuce should be separated by removing leaves fiom 
stalk (discanling wilted outer leaves), washed, kept in Oild 
water until crisp, drained, and so placed on a towel tbal , 
water may drop from leaves. A bag ma<ie from white 
mosquito netting is useful for drying lettuce. Wasi 
lettuce leaves, place in bag, and hang in lower part of ice- 
box to drain. Wire baskets are used for the same par- 
pose. Arrange lettuce for serving in nearly its origiu^J 
shape. 

Onions. 

The onion belongs to the same family (Lily) as do 
nhidlot^ (jarli'c^ leek\ and diive. Onions are cooked and 
served as a vegetable. They are wholesome, and coDtau 
considerable nutriment, but are objectionable on accoQnt 
of the strong odor they impart to the breath, due to vola- 
tile substances absorbed by the blood, and by the blood 
carried to the lungs, where they are set free. The com- 
mon garden onion is obtainable throughout the year, the 
new ones appearing in market about the first of June, h 
large centres Bermuda and Spanish onions are procurable 
from March 1st to June 1st, and are of delicate flavor. 

Shallot, leek, garlic, and chive are principally used to

Remove skins from four medium-sized onions. Cut in 
thin slieeH and put in a hot omelet pan with one and one- 
half table8ix)ons butter. Cook until brown, occasionally 
BhaMng pan that onions may not burn, or turn onions, 
using a fork. Sprinkle with salt one minute before taking 
from ftre. 

Stnffed Onions. 

Remove skins from onions, and parboil ten minutes in 
boiling salted water to cover. Turn upside down to cool, 
and remove part of centres. Fill cavities with equal 
i>arts of finely chopped cooked chicken, stale soft bread 
orumbs, and finely chopped onion which was removed, 
seasoned with salt and pepper, and moistened with cream 
or melted butter. Place in buttered shallow baking-pan, 
sprinkle with buttered crumbs, and bake in a moderate 
oven until onions are soft. 

Creamed Oyster Plant (Salsify). 

Wash, scrape, and put at once into cold acidulated 
?ater to prevent discoloration. Cut in inch slices, cook

Salsify Fritters. 

Cook oyster plant as for Creamed Oyster Plant M a^ 
season with butter, salt, and pepper. Shape in small fist 
cakes, roll in flour, and saute in butter. 

Parsnips. 

Parsnips are not so commonly served as other vege- 
tables ; however, they often accompany a boiled dinner. 
They are raised mostly for feeding cattle. Unless young- 
they contain a large amount of woody fibre, which extends^ 
through centi'e of roots and makes them undesirable a» 
food. 

Parsnips with Drawn Butter Saoce. 

Wash and scrape parsnips, and cut in pieces two inches 
long and one-half inch wide and thick. Cook five nttin- 
utcs in boiling salted water, or until soft. Drain, and to 
two cups add one cup Drawn Butter Sauce. 

Parsnip Fritters. 

Wash parsnips and cook forty-five minutes in bofling 
salted water. Drain, plunge into cold water, w^hen skies 
will be found to slip off easily. Mash, season with bat- 
ter, salt, and pepper, shape in sqiall flat round cakes, roll 
in flour, and saute in butter. 

Peas. 

Peas contain, next to beans, the largest percentage 
of proteid of any of the vegetables, and when young 
are easy of digestion. They appear in market as 
early as April, coming from Florida and Califoniia, ami 
although high hi price are hardly worth buying, they 
having been picked so long. Native peas may be ob- 
tained the middle of June, and last until the first of Sep- 
tember. The early June are small peas contained in a 



VEGETABLES. 267 

small pod. McLean, the best peas, are small peas in 
large flat pods. Champion peas are large, and the pods 
are well filled, but they lack sweetness. Marrowfat peas 
are the largest in the market, and are usually sweet. ¦ 

Boiled FeaB. 

Bemove peas from pods, cover with cold water, and let 
stand one-half hour. Skim off undeveloped peas which 
rise to top of water, and drain remaining peas. Cook 
until soft in a small quantity of boiling water, adding salt 
the last fifteen minutes of cooking. (Consult Time Table 
for Cooking, p. 33.) There should be but little, if any, 
water to drain from peas when they are cooked. Season 
with butter, salf, and pepper. If peas have lost much 
of their natural sweetness, they are improved by the 
addition of a small amount of sugar. 

Creamed Feafi. 

Drain Boiled Peas, and to two cups peas add three- 
fourths cup White Sauce II. Canned peas are often

Stuffed Peppers 11. 

Prepare peppers as for Stuffed Peppers I. Fill witfc 
equal parts of finely chopped cold cooked chicken or veal, 
and softened bread crumbs, seasoned with onioa jaioe. 
salt, and pepper. 

Pumpkins. 

Pumpkins are boiled or steamed same as squash, hut 
require longer cooking. They are principally used for 
making pies. 

Radishes. 

Radishes may be obtained throughout the year. There 
are round and long varieties, the small round ones being 
considered best. They are bought in bunches, six or 
seven constituting a bunch. Radishes are used merely 
for a relish, and are served uncooked. To prepare 
radishes for table, remove leaves, stems, and tip end of 
root, scrape roots, and serve on crushed ice. Round 
radishes look very attractive cut to imitate tulips, when 
they should not be scraped ; to accomplish this, begin at 
root end and make six incisions through skin running 
three-fourths length of radish. Pass knife under sections 
of skin, and cut down as far as incisions extend. Place 
in cold water, and sections of skin will fold back, giving 
radish a tulip-like appearance. 

Spinach. 

Spinach is cheapest and best in early sununer, but is 
obtainable throughout the year. It gives variety to winter 
diet, when most green vegetables are expensive and of in- 
ferior quality. 

Boiled Spinach. 

Remove roots, carefully pick over (discarding wilted 
leaves), and wash in several waters to be sure that it is 
free from all sand. When young and tender put in a stew- 



VEGETABLES. 269 

pan, allow to heat gradually, and cook twenty-five min- 
utes, or until tender, in its own juices. Old spinach is 
better cooked in boiling salted water, allowing two quarts 
water to one peck spinach. Drain thoroughly, chop 
finely, reheat, and season with butter, salt, and pepper. 
Garnish with slices of hard boiled eggs. The green color 
of spinach is better retained by cooking in a large quantity 
of water in an uncovered vessel. 

Spinach & la Bechamel. 

Prepare one-half peck Boiled Spinach. Put three ta- 
blespoons butter in hot omelet pan; when melted, add 
chopped spinach, cook three minutes. Sprinkle with two 
tablespoons flour, stir thoroughly, and add gradually three- 
fourths cup milk ; cook five minutes. 

Squash. 

Summer squash, which are in market during the summer 
months, should be young, tender, and thin skinned. The 
common varieties are the white round and yellow crook- 
neck. Some of the winter varieties appear in market as 
early as the middle of August ; among the most common 
are Marrow, Turban, and Hubbard. Turban and Hubbard, 
are usually drier than Marrow. Marrow and Turban 
have a thin shell, which may be pared off before cooking. 
Hubbard Squash has a very hard shell, which must be 
split in order to separate squash in pieces, and squash 
then cooked in the shell. In selecting winter squash, see 
that it is heavy in proportion to its size. 

Boiled Bummer Squash. 

Wash squash and cut in thick slices or quarters. Cook 
twenty minutes -in boiling salted water, or until soft. 
Turn in a cheese cloth placed over a colander, drain, and 
wring in cheese cloth. Mash, and season with butter, salt, 
and pepper.

CHAPTER XX. 
POTATOES. 

COMPOSITION. 

Water 78.9 % . Proteid 2.1 % . 

Starch 18% . Mineral matter .9;. 

Fat.l%. 

TDOTATOES stand pre-eminent among the vegeUMei 
-*¦ used for food. They are tubers belonging t» tbi 
Nightshade family ; their hardy growth renders tki 
easy of cultivation in almost any soil or cHmate, «kL 
resiHting early frosts, they may be raised in a higher lati- 
tude than the cereals. 

They give nee<led bulk to food rather than nutriment, 
and, lacking in proteid, should be used in combination will 
meat, fish, or eggs. 

Potatoes contain an acrid juice, the greater part d 
which lies near the skin ; it passes into the water doriia 
boiling of potatoes, and escapes with the steam fromi 
baked potato. 

Potatoes are best in the fall, and keep well throopk 
the muter. By spring the starch is partially changed to 
dextrin, giving the potatoes a sweetness, and when cooterf 
a waxiness. The same change takes place when i)otatoes 
are frozen. To prevent freezing, keep a pail of cold witer 
standing near them. 

Potatoes keep best in a cool dry cellar, in band* 
or piled in a bin. When sprouts appear they shoald I* 
removed ; receiving their nourishment from the stareh, tJiej 
deteriorate the potato. 



POTATOES. 277 

New ix)tatoes may be compared U) uiiripe fruit, the 
irch grains not having reached maturity ; therefore they 
auld not be given to children or invalids. 

Sweet PotatoeB. 

Sweet potatoes, although analogous to white potatoes, 
B fleshy roots of the plant, belong to a different family 
on volvulus), and contain a much larger percentage of 
gar. Our own country produces large quantities of 
'eet potatoes, which may be grown as far north as New 
rsey and Southern Michigan. Kiln-dried sweet potatoes 
e the best, as they do not so quickly spoil. 

Baked Potatoes. 

Select smooth, medium-sized potatoes. Wash, using a 
igetable brush, and place in dripping-pan. Bake in hot 
ren forty minutes or until soft, remove from oven and 
tr\'e at once. If allowed to stand, unless the skin is 
Lptured for escape of steam, they become soggy. Prop- 
ly baked iK)tatoes are more easily digested than potatoes 
K>ked in any other way, as some of the starch is changed 
> dextrin by the intense heat. They are better cooked 
I boiling water than baked in a slow oven. 

Boiled PotatoeB. 

Select potatoes of uniform size. Wash, pare, and drop 
t once in cold water to prevent discoloration ; soak one 
alf-hour in the fall, and one to two hours in winter and 
[)ring. Cook in boiling salted water until soft, which is 
asily determined by piercing with a skewer. For seven 
otatoes allow one tablespoon salt, and boiling water to 
c>ver. Drain from water, and keep uncovered in warm 
lace until ser^^ng time. Avoid sending to table in a 
overed vegetable dish. In boiling large potatoes, it 
ften happens that outside is soft, while centre is under- 
one. To finish cooking without potatoes breaking apart, 
dd one pint cold water, which drives heat to centre, thus 
iccomplishing the cooking.

CHAPTER XXT. 
SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS. 

C ALADS, which constitute a course in almost every din- 
^ ner, but a few years since seldom appeared on the 
table. They, are now made in an endless variety of ways, 
and are composed of meat, fish, vegetables (alone or in 
combination) or fruits, with the addition of a dressing. 
The salad plants, lettuce, watercress, chiccory, eucum- 
liers, etc., contain but little nutriment, but are cooling, 
refreshing, and assist in stimulating the appetite. They 
are valuable for the water and potash salts they contain. 
The olive oil, which usually forms the largest part of the 
dressing, furnishes nutriment, and is of much value to tlie 
system. 

Salads made of greens should always be served crisp 
and cold. The vegetables should be thoroughly washed, 
allowed to stand in cold or ice water until crisp, then 
drained and spread on a towel and set aside in a cold 
place until serving time. See Lettuce, page 263. Dress- 
ing may be added at table or just before sending to 
table. If greens are allowed to stand in dressing they 
will soon wilt. It should be remembered that winter 
greens are raised under glass and should be treated as 
any other hothouse plant. Lettuce will be affected by a 
change of temperature and wilt just as quickly as delicate 
flowers. 

Canned or cold cooked left-over vegetables are well 
utilized in salads, but are best mixed with French Dress- 
ing and allowed to stand in a cold place one hour before 
senring. Where several vegetables are used in the same

salad they should be marinated separately, and arranged 
for serving just before sending to table. 

Meat for salads should be freed from skin and gristle, 
cut in small cubes, and allowed to stand mixed with French 
Dressing before combining with vegetables. Fish should 
be flaked or cut in cubes. 

Where salads are dressed at table, first sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, add oil, and lastly vinegar. If vin^ar 
is added before oil, the greens will become wet, and oil 
will not cling, but settle to bottom of bowl. 

A Chapon. Remove a small piece from end of French 
loaf and rub over with a clove of garlic, first dipped in 
salt. Place in bottom of salad bowl before arranging 
salad. A chapon is often used in vegetable salads, and 
gives an agreeable additional flavor. 

To Marinate. The word marinate, used in cookery, 
means to add salt, pepper, oil, and vinegar to a salad in- 
gredient or mixture and let stand until well seasoned.

ifflooth consistency may be restored by taking yolk of 
another egg and adding curdled mixture slowly to it. It 
3 desirable to have bowl containing mixture placed in a 
aiger bowl of crushed ice, to which a small quantity of 
rater has been added. Olive oil for making Mayonnaise 
ihould always be thoroughly chilled. A silver fork, wire 
rhisk, small wooden spoon, or Dover Egg-beater may 
le used as preferred. If one has a Keystone Egg-beater, 
Lre^sing may be made very quickly by its use. Mayon- 
laise should be stiff enough to hold its shape. It soon 
iquefies when added to meat or vegetables ; therefore it 
ihould be adde<l just before serving time.

314 



BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 



To Heat Timbale Iron. Heat fat until nearly hot 
enough to fry uncooked mixtures. Put iron into hot fat, 
having fat deep enough to more than cover it, and let 
stand until heated. The only way of knowing when iroe 
is of right temperature is to take it from fat, shake what 
fat may drip from it, lower in batter to three- fourtiis ite 
depth, raise from batter, then immerse in hot fat. If 
batter does not cling to iron, or drops from iron as soon 
as immersed in fat, it is either too hot or not satficieDtij 
heated. 




Timbale irons and cases. 



To Form Timbalea. Turn timbale batter into a cap. 
Lower hot iron into cup, taking care that batter covers 
iron to only three-fourths its depth. When immersed in 
fat, mixture will rise to top of iron, and when crisp ami 
brown may be easily slipped off. If too much batter is 
used, in cooking it will rise over top of iron, and in order 
to remove timbale it must be cut around with a sharp 
knife close to top of iron. If the cases are soft rather thao 
crisp, batter is too thick and must be diluted with milk. 

Fill cases with Creamed Oysters, Chicken, Sweet- 
breads, or Chicken and Sweetbreads in combination with 
Mushrooms.

game, or vegetables are to be served moulded in jeOj. 
In making Aspic Jelly, use as much liquid as the pu 
which is to contain moulded dish will hold. 

Put vegetables, seasonings, and wine (except two table 
spoons) in a saucepan; cook eight minutes, and strain, 
reserving liquid. Add gelatine to stock, then add lemon 
juice. Heat to boiliug point and add strained liquid. 
Season with salt and cayenne. Beat whites of e^

sliced and cut in fancy shapes. The smaller the shapes 
the more elaborate may be the designs. When garnishing 
with small shapes, pieces are so difficult to handle that 
they should be taken on the pointed end of a larding- 
needle, and placed as desired on jelly. Add aspic mix- 
ture by spoonfuls, that designs may not he disturbed. 
When mixture is added, and firm to the depth of three- 
fourths inch, place in the bird, breast down. If sides of

spattering of cream. The first whip which appears 
should be stirred into cream, as air bubbles are too large 
and will break ; second whip should be removed by spoon- 
fuls to a strainer, strainer to be placed in a pan, as some 
cream will drain through. The first which drains through 
may be turned into bowl to be re-whipped, and continue 
whipping as long as possible. 

There will be some cream left in bowl, which does 
not come above perforations in whip churn, and cannot 
be whipped. Cream which remains may be scalded and 
used to dissolve gelatine when making desserts which re- 
quire gelatine. Cream should treble its bulk in whipping. 
By following these directions one need have no difliiculty, 
if cream is of right consistency ; always bearing in mind 
heavy cream calls for Dover egg-beater, thin cream for 
whip churn.

CHAPTER XXVI. 

ICES, ICE CREAMS. AND OTHER FROZEN DESSERTS. 

T CES anfi other frozen dishes comprise the most popular 
^ desserts. Hygienically speaking, they cannot be 
recommended for the final course of a dinner, as cold 
mixtures reduce the temperature of the stomach, thus re- 
tarding digestion until the normal temperature is again 
reached. But how cooling, refreshing, and nourishing, 
when properly taken, and of what inestimable value in the 
sick room ! 

Frozen dishes include : — 

Water Ice^ — fruit juice sweetened, diluted with water, 
and frozen. 

Sherbet^ — water ice to which is added a small quantity 
of dissolved gelatine or beaten whites of eggs. 

Frappiy — water ice frozen to consistency of mush ; in 
freezing, equal parts of salt and ice being used to make it 
granular. 

Punchy — water ice to which is added spirit and spice. 

Sorbet^ — strictly speaking, frozen punch ; the name is 
often given to a water ice where several kinds of fruit are 
used. 

Philadelphia Ice Oream^ — thin cream, sweetened, fla- 
vored, and frozen. 

Plain Ice Cream^ — custard foundation, thin cream, and 
flavoring. 

Mousse^ — heavy cream, beat-en until stiff, sweetened, 
flavored, placed in a mould, packed in equal parts salt and 
ice, and allowed to stand three hours ; or whip from thin 
cream may be used folded into mixture containing small 
quantity of gelatine. 



366 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

How to Freeze Desaerts. 

The prejudice of thinking a frozen dessert difficult to 
prepare has long since been overcome. With ice cream 
freezer, burlap bag, wooden mallet or axe, small sauce- 
pan, sufficient ice and coarse rock salt, the process neither 
takes much time nor patience. Snow may be used instead 
of ice ; if not readily acted on by salt, pour in one cup 
cold water. Crush ice finely by placing in bag and giving 
a few blows with mallet or broad side of axe ; ft there are 
any coarse pieces, remove them. Place can containing 
mixture to be frozen in wooden tub, cover, and adjust top. 
Turn crank to make sure can fits in socket. Allow three 
level measures ice to one of salt, and repeat until ice and 
salt come to top of can, packing solidly, using handle of 
mallet to force it down. If only small quantity is to be 
frozen, the ice and salt need come only little higher in the 
tub than mixture to be frozen. These are found the best 
proportions of ice and stdt to insure smooth, fine-grained 
cream, sherbet, or water ice, while equal parts of salt and 
ice are used for freezing frapp^. If a larger proportion 
of salt is used, mixture will freeze in shorter time and be 
of granular consistency, which is desirable only for frappe- 

The mixture increases in bulk during freezing, so the 
can should never be more than three-fourths filled ; by 
overcrowding can, cream will be made coarse grained. 
Turn the crank slowly and steadily to expose as large sur- 
face of mixture as possible to ice and salt. After frozen 
to a mush, the crank may be turned more rapidly, adding 
more ice and salt if needed ; never draw off salt water 
until mixture is frozen, unless there is possibility of its 
getting into the can, for salt water is what effects freez- 
ing; until ice melts, no change will take place. After 
freezing is accomplished, draw off water, remove dasher, 
and with spoon pack solidly. Put cork in opening of cover, 
then put on cover. Re-pack freezer, using four measures 
ice to one of salt Place over top newspapers or piece of 
carpet; when serving time comes, remove can, wipe care- 



ICES, ICE CREAMS, ETC. 367 

', and place in vessel of cool water ; let stand one miu- 
remove cover, and run a knife around edge of cream, 
rt can on serving-dish, ^nd frozen mixture will slip 
Should there be any difficulty, a cloth wrung out of 
water, passed over can, will aid in removing mixture. 

To Une a Mould. 

\.ilow mould to stand in salt and ice until well chilled. 
move cover, put in mixture by spoonfuls, and spread 
ii hack of spoou or a case knife evenly three-quarters 
ih thick. 

To Mould Frozen Mixtures. 

When frozen mixtures are to be bricked or moulded, avoid 
fcezing too hard. Pack mixture solidly in moulds and 
>ver with buttered paper, buttered side up. Have moulds 
> well filled that mixture is forced down sides of mould 
hen cover is pressed down. Repack in salt and ice, 
sing four parts ice to one part salt If these directions 
re carefully followed, one may feel no fear that salt water 
rill enter cream, even though moulds be immersed in salt 
fatex.

CHAPTER XXVn. 

FASTBY. 

P ASTRY cannot be easily excluded from the menu of 
-*- the New Engiander. Who can dream of a Thanks- 
giving dinner without a pie! The last decade has done 
much to remove pies from the daily bill of fare, and m 
their place are found delicate puddings and seasonable 
fruits. 

If pastry is to be served, have it of the best, — light, 
flaky, and tender. 

To pastry belongs, 1st, PuflP Paste ; 2d, Plain Paste. 

Puff paste, which to many seems so diflScult of prepa- 
ration, is rarely attempted by any except professionals. 
As a matter of fact, one who has never handled a rolling 
pin is less liable to fail, under the guidance of a good 
teacher, than an old cook, who finds it difficult to over- 
come the bad habit of using too much force in rolling. 
It is necessary to work rapidly and with a light touch. 
A cold room is of great advantage. 

For making pastry, pastry flour and the best shorten- 
ings, thoroughly chilled, are essential. Its lightness de- 
pends on the amount of air enclosed and expansion of 
that air in baking. The flakiness depends upon kind and 
amount of shortening used. Lard makes more tender 
crust than butter, but lacks flavor which butter gives. 
Puff paste is usually shortened with butter, though some 
chefs prefer beef suet. Eggs and ice were formerly used, 
but are not essentials. 

Butter should be washed if pastry is to be of the best, 
so as to remove salt and buttermilk, thus making it of a 
waxy consistency, easy to handle. 



PASTRY. 388 

Rules for Washing Butter. Scald and chill an earthen 
bowl. Heat palms of hands in hot water, and chill in 
cold water. By following these directions, butter will 
not adhere to bowl nor hands. Wash butter in bowl by 
squeezing with hands until soft and waxy, placing bowl 
under a cold-water faucet and allowing water to run. A 
small amount of butter may be washed by using a wooden 
spoon in place of the hands. 

For rolling paste, use a smooth wooden board, and 
wooden rolling-pin with handles. 

Puff paste should be used for vol-au-vents, patties, 
rissoles, bouchees, cheese straws, tarts, etc. It may be 
used for rims and upper crusts of pies, but never for 
lower crusts. Plain paste may be used where pastry is 
needed, except for vol-au-vents and patties. 




Puff paste before and after folding in butter. 

Pii£F Paste. 

1 pound butter. 1 pound pastry flour. 

Cold water. 

Wash the butter, pat and fold until no water flies. 
Reserve two tablespoons of butter, and shape remainder 
into a circular piece one-half inch thick, and put on 
floured board. Work two tablespoons of butter into 
flour with the tips of fingers of the right hand. Moisten 



884 B08T0K COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

to a dough with cold water, turn on slightly floured board, 
and knead one minute. Cover with towel, and let stand 
five minutes. 

Pat and roll one-fourth inch thipk, keeping paste a 
little wider than long, and corners square. If this can- 
not be accomplished with rolling-pin, draw into shape 
with fingers. Place butter on centre of lower half of 
paste. Cover butter by folding upper half of paste 
over it. Press edges firmly to enclose as much air as 
possible. 

Fold right side of paste over enclosed butter, the left 
side under enclosed butter. Turn paste half-way loond, 
cover, and let stand five minutes. Pat and roil one- 
fourth inch thick, having paste longer than wide, lift- 
ing often to prevent paste from sticking, and dredging 
board slightly with flour when necessary. Fold from ends 
towards centre, making three layers. Cover, and let stand 
five minutes. Repeat twice, turning paste half-way round 
each time before rolling. After fourth rolling, fold from 
ends to centre, and double, making four layers. Pat in 
cold place to chill; if outside temperature is not enflS- 
ciently cold, fold paste in a towel, put in a dripping-pan, 
and place between dripping pans of crushed ice. If paste 
is to be kept for several days, wrap in a napkin, put in 
tin pail and cover tightly, then put in cold place ; if in 
ice box, do not allow pail to come in direct contact with 
ice. 

To Bake Puff Paste. 

Baking of puff paste requires as much care and judg- 
ment as making. After shaping, chill thoroughly before 
baking. Puff paste requires hot oven, greatest heat com- 
ing from the bottom, that the paste may properly rise. 
While rising it is often necessary to decrease the heat by 
lifting covers or opening the check to stove. Turn fre- 
quently that it may rise evenly. . When it has risen its full 
height, slip a pan under the sheet on which paste is baking 
to prevent burning on the bottom. Puff paste should be 



1 



I 



PASTRY. 885 

baked on a tin sheet covered witli a doable thickness of 
brown paper, or drippiug-pan may be used, lined with 
brown paper. The temperature for baking of patties 
shoald be about the same as for raised biscuit; vol-au- 
vents require less heat, and are covered for first half -hour 
to prevent scorching on top. 

Patty BhellB. 

Roll puff paste one-quarter inch thick, shape with a patty 
cntter, first dipped in flour ; remove centres from one-half 
the rounds with smaller cutter. Brush over with cold 
water the larger pieces near the edge, and fit on rings, 
pressing lightly. Place in towel between pans of crushed* 
ice, and chill until paste is stiff ; if cold weather, chill out 
of doors. Place on iron or tin sheet covered with brown 
paper, and bake twenty-five minutes in hot oven. The 
shells should rise their full height and begin to brown in 
twelve to fifteen minutes ; continue browning, and finish 
baking in twenty-five minutes. Pieces cut from centre of 
rings of patties may be baked and used for patty covers, 
or put together, rolled, and cut for unders. Trimmings 
from puff paste should be carefully laid on top of each 
other, patted, and rolled out. 

Vol-an-ventB. 

Roll puff paste one-third inch thick, mark an oval on 
paste with cutter or mould, and cut out with sharp knife, 
first dipped in flour. Brush over near the edge with cold 
water, put on a rim three-fourths inch wide, press lightly, 
chill, and bake. Vol-au-vents require for baking forty- 
five minutes to one hour. During the first half-hour they 
should be covered, watched carefully, and frequently 
turned. The paste cut from centre of rim should be rolled 
one-quarter inch thick, shaped same size as before rolling, 
chilled, baked, and used for cover to the Vol-au-vent.

Plain Paste. 

1)4 cups flour. >4 cup butter. 

^ cup lard. ^2 teaspoon salt 

Cold water. 

Wash butter, pat, and form in circular piece. Add salt 
to flour, and work in lard with tips of fingers or ease knife. 
Moisten to dough with cold water; ice water is not u 
essential, but is desirable in summer. Toss on board 
dredged spai*ingly with flour, pat, and roll out ; fold Id 
butter as for puff paste, pat, and roll out. Fold so as to 
make three layers, turn half-way round, pat, and roll cot; 
repeat The pastry may be used at once ; if not, fold in 
cheese cloth, put in covered tin, and keep in cold place, 
but never in direct contact with ice. Plain paste requires 
a moderate oven. This is superior paste and quioklj 
made. 

Quick Paste. 

\}^ cups flour. }^ cup cottolene or cocoanul 

}^ teaspoon salt. butter. 

Cold water. 

Mix salt with flour, cut in shortening with knife. Moisten 
to dough with cold water. Toss on floured l)oanl, pat 
roll out, and roll up like a jelly roll. Use one-third cup of 
shortening if a richer paste is desired. 

Paste with Lard. 

1)4 c^ips floui'. l^ cup lard. 

}4 teaspoon salt. Cold water. 

Mix salt with flour. Reserve one and one-fourth table- 
spoons laixi, work in remainder to flour, using tips of fin- 
gers or a case knife. Moisten to a dough with water. 
Toss on a floured board, pat, and roll out. Spread with 
one tablespoon reser\'ed lard, dredge with flour, roll up 
like a jelly roll, pat, and roll out; again roll up. Cot 
from the end of roll a piece large enough to line a pie plate. 
Pat and roll out, keeping the paste as circular in form as 



PASTRY. 387 

[K>8Bible. With care and experience there need be no 
trimmings. Worked-over pastry is never as satisfactory. 
I*lie remaining one-fourth tablespoon lard is used to dot 
Dver upper crust of pie just before sending to oven ; this 
gives the pie a flaky appearance. Ice water has a similar 
effect. If milk is brushed over the pie it has a glazed ap- 
pearance. This quantity of paste will make one pie with 
two crusts and a few puffs, or two pies with one crust 
where the rim is built up and fluted. 



388 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 



k^ 



CHAPTER XXVIII. 

PIES. 

pASTE for pies should be one- fourth inch thick aiid 
-¦¦ rolled a little larger than the plate to allow for shrink- 
ing. In dividing paste for pies, allow more for upper than 
under crusts. Always perforata upper crusts that steam 
may escape. Some make a design, others pierce with a 
large fork. 

Flat rims ^or pIo« should be cut in strips three-fourtte 
inch wide, ^nder crusts should be brushed with cold 
water before putting on rims, and rims slightly fuUeilf 
otherwise they will shrink from edge of plate. The pastry- 
jagger, a simple device for cutting paste, makes rims with ^ 
fluted edges. 

Pies requiring two crusts sometimes have a rim betweenl 
the crusts. This is mostly confined to mince pies, where! 
there is little danger of juice escaping. Sometimes a rin 
is placed over upper crust. Where two pieces of pa8t«| 
are put together, the under piece should always be brushes 
with cold water, the upper piece placed over, and the U 
pressed lightly together ; otherwise they will separate dur] 
ing baking. 

When juicy fruit is used for filling pies, some of 1 
juices are apt to escape during baking. As a precauti« 
bind with - .rip of cotton cloth wrung out of cold wate 
and cut c.it inch wide and long enough to encircle th 
plate. Squash, pumpkin, and custard pies are muehlw 
care during baking when bound. AVhere cooked fruitei 
used for filling, it is desirable to bake crusts separatel]^ 
This is best accomplished by covering an inverted ( 



piBS. 889 

pie plate with paste and baking for under crust. Prick 
with a fork before baking. Slip from plate and fill. For 
upper crusts, roil a piece of paste a little larger than the 
pie plate, prick, and bake on a tin sheet. 

For baking pies, perforated tin plates are used. They 
may be bought shallow or deep. By the use of such plates 
the under crust is well cooked. Pastry should be thor- 
oughly baked and well browned. Pies require from thirty- 
five to forty-five minutes for baking. Never grease a pie 
plate ; good pastry greases its own tin. Slip pies, when 
slightly cooled, to earthen plates. 

Apple Pie I. 

4 or 5 sour apples. ^ teaspoon salt. 

}4 cup sugar. 1 teaspoon batter. 

y^ teaspoon grated nutmeg. 1 teaspoon lemon Juice. 
Few gratings lemon rind. 

Line pie plate with paste. Pare, core, and cut the 
apples into eighths, put row around plate ^ .e-half inch 
from edge, and work towards centre until plate is covered ; 
then pile on remainder. Mix sugar, nutmeg, salt, lemon 
juice, and grated rind, and sprinkle over iV>pleli». Dot 
over with butter. Wet edges of under crust, cover w^Ji 
upper crust, and press edges together. 

Bake forty to forty-five minutes in moderate oven, a 
very good pie may be made without butter, lemon juice 
and grated rind. Cinnamon may be substituted for nut- 
meg. Evaporated apples may be used in place of fresh 
fruit. If used, they should be soaked over night in cold 
water. 

Apple Pie II. 

Use same ingredients as for Apple P' I. Place in 
small earthen baking-dish and add hot wat ., , ^o prevent 
apples from burning. Cover closely and bake three hours 
in very slow oven, when apples will be a dark red color. 
Brown sugar may be used instead of white sugar, a little 
more being required. Cool, and bake between two crusts.

oven. For sweetening, some prefer to use one-thinl 
molasses, the remaining two- thirds to be sugar. Six 
green grapes (from which seeds have been removed) cut in 
small pieces much improve the flavor, particularly where 
hucklebeiTies are used in place of blueberries.

quartered, cored, and pared, previous to chopping, or skins 
may be left on, which is not an objection if apples are 
finely chopped. Add quinces finely chopped, sugar, 
molasses, cider, raisins, currants, and citron; also suet,

Bake three sheets of pastry, pricking before baking. 
Put between the sheets Cream Filling; spread top with 
Confectioners* Frosting, crease in pieces about two and 
one-half by four inches, and cut with sharp knife. 

Orange Stioks. 

Cut puff or plain paste rolled one-eighth inch thick in 
strips five inches long by one inch wide, and bake in hot 
oven. Put together in pairs, with Orange Filling between. 

Lemon Sticks. 

Lemon Sticks may be made in same manner as Orai^ 
Sticks, using Lemon Filling. 

Palm Leaves. 

Roll remnants of puff paste one-eighth inch thick; 
sprinkle one-half surface with powdered sugar, fold, press 
e<lges together, pat and roll out, using sugar for dredging 
board; repeat three times. After the last rolling fold 
four times. The pastry should be in long strip one and 
one-half inches wide. From the end, cut pieces one-inch 
wide; place on baking-sheet, broad side down, one-inch 
apart, and separate layers of pastry at one end to suorgest 
a leaf. Bake eight minutes in hot oven ; these will spreail 
while baking. 

Raspberry Puffs. 

Roll plain paste one-eighth inch thick, and cnt in 
pieces four by three and one-half inches. Put one-half 
tablespoon raspberry jam on centre of lower half of each 
piece, wet edges half-way around, fold, press edges firmly 
together, prick tops, place on sheet, and bake twenty 
minutes in hot oven. Mince meat or apple sauce may be 
used for filling.

MERINGUES. 899 

Tarts. 

Roll puff paste one-eighth inch thick. Shape with a 
fluted round cutter, first dipped in flour; with a smaller 
cutter remove centres from half the pieces, leaving rings 
one-Lalf inch wide. Brush with cold water the larger 
pieces near the edge; fit on rings, pressing lightly. Chill 
thoroughly, and bake fifteen minutes in hot oven. By 
brushing tops of rings with beaten yolk of egg diluted 
with one teaspodnful water, they will have a glazed 
appearance. Cool, and fill with jam or jelly. 

Polish Tartlets. 

Roll puff or plain paste one-eighth inch thick, and cut 
in two and one-half inch squares; wet the corners, fold 
toward the centre, and press lightly ; bake on a sheet ; when 
cool, press down the centres and fill, using two-thirds 
quince marmalade and one-third currant jelly. 



MERINGUES. 
For Pies, Puddings, and Desserts. 

Eggs for meringues should be thoroughly chilled, and 
beaten with silver fork, wire spoon or whisk. Where 
several eggs are needed, much time is saved by using 
a whisk. Meringues on pies, puddings, or desserts, 
may be spread evenly, spread and piled in the centre, put 
on lightly by spoonfuls, or spread evenly with part of the 
mixture, the remainder being forced through a pastry bag 
and tube. 

Meringues I. and III. should be baked fifteen minutes in 
slow oven. Meringue II. sliould be cooked eight minutes 
in moderate oven ; if removed from oven before cooked, 
the eggs will liquefy and meringue settle ; if cooked too 
long, meringue is tough.

CHAPTER XXXI. 

CAKE. 

T^HE mixing and baking of cake requires more care 
-¦• and judgment than any other branch of cookery; 
notwithstanding, it seems the one most frequently at- 
tempted by the inexperienced. 

Two kinds of cake mixtures are considered : — 

I. Without butter. Example : Sponge Cakes. 

n. With butter. Examples : Cup and Pound Cakes. 

In cake making (1) the best ingredients are essential: 
(2) great care must be taken in measuring and combio- 
ing ingredients; (3) pans must be properly prepared: 
(4) oven heat must be regulated, and cake watched 
during baking. 

Best tub butter, fine granulated sugar, fresh e^s, and 
pastry flour are essentials for good cake. Coarse granu- 
lated sugar, bought by so many, if used in cake making, 
gives a coarse texture and hard crust. Pastry flour con- 
tains more starch and less gluten than bread flour, there- 
fore makes a lighter, more tender cake. If bread floor 
must be used, allow two tablespoons less for each oip 
than the recipe calls for. Flours differ greatly in thick- 
ening properties ; for this reason it is always well when 
using from a new bag to try a small cake, as the amoant 
of flour given may not make the perfect loaf. In winter, 
cake may be made of less flour than in summer. 

Before attempting to mix cake, study How to Measure 
(p. 27) and How to Coml)ine Ingredients (p. 29). 

Look at the fire, and replenish by sprinkling on a snail 
quantity of coal if there is not suflflcieut heat to effect the 
baking. 



CAKE. 413 

To Mix Sponge Cake. Separate yolks from whites 
of e^9. Beat yolks until thick and lemon colored, using 
an egg beater; add sugar gradually, and continue beat- 
ing ; then add flavoring. Beat whites until stiff and dry, 
— when they will fly from the beater, — and add to the 
first mixture. Mix and sift flour with salt, and cut and 
fold in at the last. If mixture is beaten after the addi- 
tion of flour, much of the work already done of enclosing 
a large amount of air will be undone by breaking air 
bubbles. These rules apply to a mixture where baking 
powder is not employed. 

To Mix Batter Cakes. An earthen bowl should al- 
ways be used for mixing cake, and a wooden cake-spoon 
with slits lightens the labor. Measure dry ingredients, 
and mix and sift baking powder and spices, if used, with 
flour. Count out number of eggs required, breaking each 
separately that there may be no loss should a stale egg 
chance to be found in the number, separating yolks 
from whites if rule so specifies. Measure butter, then 
liquid. Having everything in readiness, the mixing may 
be quickly accomplished. If butter is very hard, by al- 
lowing it to stand a short time in a warm room it is 
measured and creamed much easier. If time cannot be 
allowed fot this to be done, warm bowl by pouring in 
some hot water, letting stand one minute, then emptying 
and wiping dry. Avoid overheating bowl, as butter will 
become oily rather than creamy. Put butter in bowl, and 
cream by working with a wooden spoon until soft and of 
a creamy consistency; then add sugar gradually, and 
continue beating. Add yolks of eggs or whole eggs 
beaten until light, liquid, and flour mixed and sifted with 
baking powder ; or liquid and flour may be added alter- 
nately. When yolks and whites of eggs are beaten sep- 
arately, whites are usually added at the last, as is the 
case when whites of eggs alone are used. A cake can 
be made fine grained only by long beating, although light 
and delicate with a small amount of beating. Never stir 
cake after the final beating, remembering that beating 



414 BOSTON COOKIXG-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

motion should always be the last used. Fniii, when 
added to cake, is usually floured to prevent its settling 
to the bottom. This is not necessary if it is added di- 
rectly after the sugar, which is desirable in all dait 
cakes. If a light fruit cake is made, frait added in tiiiV 
way discolors the loaf. Citron is first cut in thin slices, 
then in strips, floured, and put in between layeis of 
cake mixtures. Raisins are seeded and cut, rather than 
choppe<l. To seed raisins^ wet tips of fingers in a cay of 
warm water. Then break skins with fingers, or cut with 
a vegetable knife ; remove seeds, and put in cup of water. 
This is better than covering raisins with warm water: if 
this be done, water clings to fruit, and when dred,fei] 
with flour a pasty mass is formed on the outside. Vi' ashed 
currants, put up iu packages, are quite free from steiifr 
and foreign substances, and need only picking over and 
rolling in flour. Currants bought in bulk need thorcx^ 
cleaning. First roll in flour, which helps to start dirt; 
wash in cold water, drain, and spread to dry; then roU 
again in flour before using. 

To Butter and FiU Pans. Grease pans with melted fat 
applying the same with a butter brush. If butter is 
useiU put in a small saucepan and place on back of range; 
when melte<l, salt will settle to the bottom; butter i« 
then calle<l clarified. Just before putting in mixture, 
dredge ])ans thoroughly with flour, invert, and shake 
pan to remove all su))erflous flour, leaving only a thin 
coating which adheres to butter. This gives to cake a 
smooth under surface, which is especially desirable if 
cake is U^ he frosted. Pans may be lined with fwp^''- 
If this is done, paper should just cover bottom of p«n 
and project over sides. Then ends of pan and paper *« 
buttered. 

In filling pans, have the mixture come well to tbe 
corners and sides of pans, leaving a slight depression w 
the centre, and when baked the cake will be perfecuv 
flat on top. Cake pans should be filled nearly two-thir<fcj 
full if cake is expected to rise to top of pan. 



CAKE. 415 

To Bake Cake. The baking of cake is more critical 
than the mixing. Many a well-mixed cake has been 
fspoiled in the baking. No oven thermometer has yet 
proved practical, and although many teachers of cookery 
have given oven tests, experience alone has proved the 
most reliable teacher. In baking cake, divide the time 
required into qaarters. During the first quarter tlie 
mixture should begin to rise; second quarter, continue 
rising and begin to brown ; third quarter, continue brown- 
ing; fourth quarter, finish baking and shrink from pan. 
If oven is too hot, open check and raise back covers, or 
leave oven door ajar. It is sometimes necessary to cover 
cake with brown paper; there is, however, danger of 
cake adhering to paper. Cake should be often looked at 
during baking, and providing oven door is opened and 
closed carefully, there is no danger of this causing cake 
to fall. Cake should not be moved in oven until it has 
risen its full height ; after this time it is usually desirable 
to move it that it may be evenly browned. Cake when 
done shrinks from the pan, and in most cases this is a 
sufficient test; however, in pound cakes this rule does 
not apply. Pound and rich fruit cakes are tested by 
pressing surface with tip of finger. If cake feels firm to 
touch and follows finger back into place, it is safe to 
remove it from the oven. When baking cake arrange 
to have nothing else in the oven, and place loaf or loaves 
as near the centre of oven as possible. If placed close 
to fire box, one side of loaf is apt to become burned 
before suflBciently risen to turn. If cake is put in too 
slow an oven, it often rises over sides of pan and is of 
very coarse texture; if put in too hot an oven, it browns 
on top before suflficiently risen, and in its attempt to rise 
breaks through the crust, thus making an unsightly loaf. 
Cake will also crack on top if too much flour has been 
used. The oven should be kept at as nearly unifonn 
temperature as possible. Small and layer cakes require 
a hotter oven than loaf cakes. 



416 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

To Remove Cake from Pans. Remove cake from pans 
as sooD as it comes from the oven, by inverting pan on a 
wire cake cooler, or on a board covered with a piece of 
old linen. If cake is inclined to stick, do not hony it 
from pan, but loosen wiUi knife around edges, and rest 
pan on its four sides successively, thus by its own weight 
cake may be helped out 

To Frost Cake. Where cooked frostings are naed, it 
makes but little difference whether they are spread on hot 
or cold cake. Where uncooked frostings are used, it is 
best to have the cake slightly warm, with the excep- 
tion of Confectioners' Frosting, where boiling water is 
employed.

1 cup sugar. 1)^ teaspoons baking powder. 

•5 tablespoons cold water. %_ teaspoon salt. 

1 1^ tablespoons corn-starch. Whites 4 eggs. 
1 teaspoon lemon extract.

Put coru-starch in a cup and fill cup with flour. Mix and 
sift corn-starch and flour with baking powder and salt,

Sponge Cake. 

Yolks 6 eggs. Grated rind one-half lemon. 

1 cup sugar. Whites 6 eggs. 

1 tablespoon lemon juice. 1 cup flour. 

J^ teaspoon salt. 

Beat yolks until thick and lemon-colored, add sugar 
gradually, and continue beating, using Dover egg-beater. 
Add lemon-juice, rind, and whites of eggs beaten until 
stiff and dry. When whites are partially mixed with 
yolks, remove beater, and carefully cut and fold in flour 
mixed and sifted with salt. Bake one hour in a slow 
oven, in an angel cake pan or deep narrow pan. 

Genuine sponge cake contains no rising properties, but 
is made light by the quantity of air beaten into both yolks 
and whites of eggs, and the expansion of that air in bak- 
ing. It requires a slow oven. All so-called sponge cakes 
which have the addition of soda and cream of tartar or 
baking powder require same oven temperature as butter 
cakes. WTien failures are made in Sunshine and Angel 
Cake, they are usually traced to baking in too slow 
an oven, and removing from oven before thoroughly 
cooked.

Flavoring. 

To water add enough sifted sugar to make of right c<hi- 
sistency to spread ; then add flavoring. Fresh frait jaice 
may be used in place of boiling water. This is a most 
satisfactory frosting, and is both easily and quickly made.

sugar from adhering to saucepan ; heat gradually to boil- 
ing point., and boil without stirring until syrup will thread 
when dropped from tip of spoon or tines of silver folk. 
Pour syrup gradually on beaten white of egg, beating 
mixture constantly, and continue beating until of right 
consistency to spread ; then add flavoring and pour over 
cake, spreading evenly with back of spoon. Crease as 
soon as firm. If not beaten long enough, frosting will 
run; if beaten too long, it will not be smooth. Frosting 
beaten too long may be improved by adding a few drops 
of lemon juice or boiling water. This frosting is soft 
inside, and has a glossy surface. If frosting is to be 
ornamented with nuts or candied cherries, place them on 
frosting as soon as spread. 

Boiled Frosting. 

1 cup sugar. 1 teaspoon vanilla or 

}^ cup water. j^ tablespoon lemon juice. 

Whites 2 eggs. 

Make same as White Mountain Cream. This frosting, 
on account of the larger quantity of egg, does not stiffen so 
quickly as White Mountain Cream, therefore is more 
successfully made by the inexperienced.

Fondant Icing. 

The mixture in which small cakes are dipped for icing 
is fondant, the recipe for which may be found in chapter 
on Confections. Cakes for dipping must first be glazed. 

To Olaze Cakes. Beat white of one egg slightly, and 
add one tablespoon powdered sugar. Apply with a 
bmsh to top and sides of cakes. After glazing, cakes 
should stand over night before dipping. 

To Dip Cakes. Melt fondant over hot water, and color 
and flavor as desired. Stir to prevent crust from forming 
on top. Take cake to be dipped on a three-tined fork 
and lower in fondant three-fourths the depth of cake. 
Remove from fondant, invert, and slip from fork to a 
board. Decorate with ornamental frosting and nut meat. 
candied cherries, angelica, or candied violets. For small 
ornamented cakes, pound cake mixture is baked a little 
more than one inch thick in shallow pans, and when cool 
cut in squares, diamonds, triangles, circles, crescents, etc.

ally on beaten whites of eggs, beating constantly; then 
add acid and continue beating. When stiff enough to 
spread, put a thin coating over cake. Beat remaining 
frosting until cold and stiff enough to keep in shape 
after being forced through a pastry tube. After firet 
coating on cake has hardened, cover with a thicker layer, 
and crease for cutting. If frosting is too stiff to spread 
smoothly, thin with a few drops of water. With a pastry 
bag and variety of tubes, cake may be ornamented as

CHAPTER XXXin. 

FANCY CAKES AND CONFECTIONS. 

\ LMOND paste for making macaroons and smaU 
¦^ fancy cakes may be bought of dealers who keep 
confectioners* supplies, although sometimes a resident 
baker or confectioner will sell a small quantity. Almond 
paste is put up in five-pound tin pails, and retails for one 
and one-half dollars per pail. During the cold weather 
it will keep after being opened for a long time. 

Macaroons. 

X lb. almond paste. Whites 3 eggs. 

}i lb. powdered sugar. 

Work together almond paste and sugar on a smooth 
board or marble slab. Then add whites of eggs 
gradually, and work until mixture is perfectly smooth. 
Confectioners at first use the hand, afterward a palette 
knife, which is not only of use for mixing but for keeping 
board clean. Shape, using a pastry bag and tube, 
on a tin sheet covered with buttered paper, one-half 
inch apart ; or drop mixture from tip of spoon in small 
piles. Macaroon mixture is stiff enough to hold its 
shape, but in baking spreads. Bake fifteen to twenty 
miimtes in a slow oven. If liked soft, they should be 
slightly baked. After removing from oven, invert paper, 
and wet with a cloth wrung out of cold water, when 
macaroons will easily slip off. 



FANCY CAKES AND CONFECTIONS. 448 

Almond Macaroons. 

Sprinkle Macaroons, before baking, with almonds 
blanched and shredded, or chopped. 

Creaoenta. 

^ lb. almond paste. Almonds blanched and 

2 oz. confectioners' sugar. finely chopped. 

White 1 small Qgg. 

Mix same as Macaroons. Shape mixture, which is quite 
soft, in a long roll. Cut pieces from roll three-fourths 
inch long. Roll each separately in chopped nuts, at the 
same time shaping to form a crescent. Bake twenty 
minutes on a buttered tin sheet in a slow oven. Cool 
and frost with Confectioners' Frosting, made thin enough 
to apply with a brush, and flavored with lemon juice until 
quite acid. Other nuts may be used in place of almonds. 

Cinnamon Ban. 

10 oz. almond paste. White 1 Qgg, 

5 oz. confectioners* sugar, % teaspoon cinnamon. 

Mix same as Macaroons. Dredge a board with sugar, 
knead mixture slightly, and shape in a long roll. Pat 
and roll one-fourth inch thick, using a rolling-pin. After 
rolling, the piece should be four inches wide. Spread with 
frosting made of white of one egg and two-thirds cup 
confectioners' sugar beaten tc^ether until stiff enough to 
spread. Cut in strips four inches long by three-fourths 
inch wide. This must be quickly done, as a crust soon 
forms over frosting. To accomplish this, use two knives, 
one placed through mixture where dividing line is to be 
made, and the other used to make a clean shaq3 cut on 
both sides of first knife. Knives should be kept clean by 
wiping on a damp cloth. Remove strips, as soon as cut, 
to a tin sheet, greased with lard and then floured. Bake 
twenty minutes on centre grate in a slow oven.

Honaahoes. 

Use Cinnamon Bar mixture. Cover with frosting col- 
ored with fruit red. Cut in strips six inches long bj 
one-half inch wide. As soon as cut, shape quickly, at 
the same time carefully, in form of horseshoes. Bake 
same as Cinnamon Bars. When cool, make eight dots 
with chocolate frosting to represent nails. 

Coooanat Cakee I. 

)i Ih. fresh grated cocoanut. 6 oz. sugar and glucose, 

Whites 1}^ eggs. using one mixing-spoon 

glucose. 

German Confectumer. 

Cook cocoanut, sugar and glucose, in double boiler un- 
til mixture clings to spoon, add whites of eggs, stir 
vigorously, and cook until mixture feels sticky when 
tried between the fingers. Spread in a wet pan, cover 
with wet paper, and chill on ice. Shape in small balls, 
first dipping hands in cold water. Bake twenty minutes 
in a slow oven on a tin sheet greased with white wax. 

Ck>coanut Cakes II. 

1 lb. fresh grated cocoanut. ^ lb. sugar. 

Whites 2 ^gs. 

Cook, shape, and bake same as Cocoanut Cakes L 

Stuffed Dates I. 

Make a cut the entire length of dates and remove stones. 
Fill cavities with castanea nuts, English walnuts, or 
blanched almonds, and shape in original form. Roll in 
granulated sugar. Pile in rows on a small plate covered 
with a doily. If castanea nuts are used, with a sharp 
knife cut off the brown skin which lies next to shell. 

Stuffisd Dates II. 

Remove stones from dates and fill cavities with 
Neufchatel cheese. 



CONFECTIONS. 445 

Salted Almonds L 

Blanch one-fourth pound Jordan almonds and dry on a 
towel. Put one-third cup olive oil in a very small sauce- 
pan. When hot, put in one-fourth of the almonds and fry 
until delicately browned, stirring to keep almonds con-. 
stantJy in motion. Remove with a spoon or small skim- 
mer, taking up as little oil as possible. Drain on brown 
paper and sprinkle with salt ; repeat until all are fried. 
It may be necessary to remove some of the salt by wiping 
nnts with a napkin. 

Salted Almonds II. 

Prepare almonds as for Salted Almonds I. Fry in one- 
third cup fat, using half lard and half clarified butter or 
all cocoanirt butter. Drain and sprinkle with salt. 

Salted Peanuts. 

In buying peanuts for salting, get those which have 
not been roasted. Remove skins and fry same as Salted 
Almonds I. or II. 

Salted Pecans. 

Shelled pecans may be bought by the pound, which is 
much the best way when used for salting, as it is difficult 
to remove the nut meat without breaking. Fry same 
as Salted Almonds I. or II. Care must be taken that 
they do not remain in fat too long ; having a dark skin, 
color does not determine when they are sufficiently 
cooked. 

Parisian Sweets. 

1 lb. figs. 1 lb. English walnut meat. 

1 lb. dates. Confectioners' sugar. 

Pick over and remove stems from figs and stones from 
dates. Mix fruit with walnut meat, and force through 
a meat-chopper. Work, using the hands, on a board 
dredged with confectioners* sugar, until well blended. 
Roll to one-fourth inch thickness, using confectioners'

sugar for dredging board and pin. Shape with a snuU 
round cutter, first dipped in sugar, or cut with a sharp 
knife in three-foui*th inch squares. Roll each piece in 
confectioners' sugar, and shake to renaove superfluoas 
sugar. Pack in layers in a tin box, putting paper 
between each layer. These confections may be used at 
dinner^ in place of bonbons or ginger chips. A com- 
bination of nut meat (walnut, almond, and filbert) may 
be used in equal proportions. 

MolasBM Candy. 

2 cups Porto Rico molasses. 3 tablespoons butter. 
% cup sugar. 1 tablespoon vinegar. 

An iron kettle with a rounding bottom (Scotch kettle), 
or copper kettle is best for candy making. If one has do 
copper kettle, a granite kettle is best for sugar candies. 

Put butter in kettle, place over fire, and when melted 
add molasses and sugar. Stir until sugar is dissolved. 
During the first of the boiling, stirring is unnecessary; 
but when nearly cooked, it should be constantly stirred. 
Boil until, when tried in cold water, mixture will become 
brittle. Add vinegar just before taking from fire. Pour 
into a well buttered pan. When cool enough to handle, 
pull until porous and light colored, allowing candy to 
come in contact with tips of fingers and thumbs, not to lie 
squeezed in the hand. Cut in small pieces, using lai^e 
shears or a sharp knife, and then arrange on slightiy 
buttered plates to cool. 

Velvet Molasses Candy. 

1 cup molasses. 3 tablespoons vinegar. 

3 cups sugar. j^ teaspoon cream of tartar. 
1 cup boiling water. }^ cup melted butter. 

J^ teaspoon soda. 

Put first four ingredients in kettle placed over front of 
range. As soon as boiling point is reached, add cream 
of tartar. Boil until, when tried in cold water, mixtore

2 cups molasses. 2 tablespoons butter. 

1 cup sugar. 3^ teaspoon cream of tartar, 

j^ cup boiling water. Fondant flavored with vanilla. 

Boil ingredients (except fondant) until, when tried in 
cold water, a firm ball may be formed in the fingers, not 
stirring until the last few miimtes of cooking. Pour on 
a buttered platter, and when cool enough to handle, pull 
until light colored. Shape on a floureil board, having 
strip wide enough to enclose a roll of fondant one inch 
in diameter. Place fondant on candy, bring edges of 
candy together, and press firmly over fondant. With 
both hands pull candy into a long strip. Cut in small 
pieces; each piece will consist of fondant encircled with 
molasses candy. Care must be taken that candy is not 
cooked too long, as it should be soft rather than brittle. 

Vinegar Candy. 

2 cups sugar. % cup vinegar. 

2 tablespoons butter. 

Put butter into kettle; when melted, add sugar and 
vinegar. Stir until sugar is dissolved, afterwards occa- 
sionally. Boil until, when tried in cold water, mixture 
will become brittle. Turn on a buttered platter to cool. 
Pull and cut same as Molasses Candy.

towards centre. As soon as it can be handled, puU ODtfl 
white and glossy. While pulling, flavor as desired, using 
vanilla, orange extract, coffee extract, oil of sassafras, 
or melted chocolate. Cat in sticks or small pieces. 

Batter Scotch. 

1 cup sugar. 2 tablespoons vinegar. 

y^ cup molasses. 2 tablespoons boiling water. 

yi cup butter. 

Boil ingredients together until, when tried in cold water, 
mixture will become brittle. Turn into a well battered 
pan ; when slightly cool, mark with a sharp-pointed knife 
in squares. This candy is much improved by cooking a 
small piece of vanilla bean with other ingredients. 

Bvtter TbSj, 

2 cups light brown sugar. 2 tablespoons water. 

}^ cup molasses. % teaspoon salt. 

2 tablespoons vinegar. J^ cup butter. 

2 teaspoons vanilla. 

Boil first five ingredients until, when tried in cold water, 
mixture will become brittle. When nearly done, add 
butter, and just before turning into pan, vanilla. Cool, 
and mark in squares. 

Horehonnd Candy. 

% square inch pressed 2 cups boiling water, 

horehound. . 3 cups sugar. 

% teaspoon cream of tartar. 

Pour boiling water over horehound which has been 
separated in pieces; let stand one minute, then strain 
through double cheese cloth. Put into a granite kettle 
with remaining ingredients, and boil until, when tried in 
cold water, mixture will become brittle. Turn into a

Caramel, 350°. 

Fondant, the basis of all French candy, is made of 
sugar and water boiled together (with a small quantity 
of cream of tartar to prevent sugar from granulating) to 
soft ball, 288° F. The professional confectioner is able 
to decide when syrup has boiled to the right temperature 
by sound while boiling, and by testing in cold water; 
these tests at first seem somewhat diflficult to the amateur, 
but only a little experience is necessary to make fondant 
successfully. A sugar thermometer is often employed, 
and proves valuable, as by its use one need not exercise 
his judgment. 

White Fondant. 

2% lbs. sugar. \% cups hot water. 

J^ teaspoon cream of tartar. 

Put ingredients into a smooth granite stewpan. Stir, 
place on range, and heat gradually to boiling point. 
Boil without stirring until, when tried in cold water, a 
soft ball may be formed that will just keep in shape, 
which is 238° F. After a few^ minntes' boiling, sugar will

adhere to sides of kettle ; this should be washed oflf with 
the hand first dipped in cold water. Have a pan of cold 
water near nt hand, dip hand in cold water, then quickly 
wash off a small part of the sugar w^ith tips of fingers, and 
repeat until all sugar adhering to side of saucepan is re- 
moved. If this is quickly done, there is no danger of bnro- 
ing the fingers. Pour slowly on a slightly oileil marble slab. 
Let stand a few minutes to cool, but not long enough to 
become hard around the edge. Scrape fondant with chop- 
ping knife to one end of marble, and work with a wooden 
spatula until white and creamy. It will (quickly change 
from this consistency, and begin to lump, when it should 
be kneaded with. the hands until perfectly smooth. 

Put into a bowl, cover with oiled paper to exclude air, 
that a crust may not form on top, and let stand twenty- 
four hours. A large oiled platter and wooden stxK)n may 
l)e used in place of marble slab and spatula. Always 
make fondant on a clear day, as a damp, heavy atmos- 
phere has an unfavorable effect on the boiling of sugar. 

Coffee Fondant. 

2}^ lbs. sugar. V4 cup ground coffee. 

1^2 c^P'^ cold water. ^ teaspoon cream of tartar. 

Put water and coffee in saucepan, and heat to boiling 
point. Strain through double cheese cloth; then add 
sugar and cream of tartar. Boil and work same as White 
P'ondant. 

Maple Fondant. 

1^4 lbs. maple sugar. 1 cup hot water. 

ly^ lbs. sugar. ^ teaspoon cream of tartar. 

Break maple sugar in pieces, and add to remaining in- 
gredients. Boil and work same as White Fondant. 

Bonbons. 

The centres of bonbons are made of fondant shaped 
in small balls. If White Fondant is used, flavor as de- 
sired, — vanilla being usually preferred. For cocoannt 



CONFECTIONS. 455 

centres, work as much shredded cocoaiuit as possible into 
a small quantity of fondant; for nut centres, surround 
pieces of nut meat with fondant, using just enough to 
cover. French candied cherries are often used in this 
way. Allow balls to stand over night, and dip the fol- 
lowing day. 

To Dip Bonbons. Put fondant in saucepan, and melt 
over hot water; color and flavor as desired. In coloring 
fc»ndant, dip a small wooden skewer in coloring paste, 
take up a small quantity, and dip skewer in fondant. If 
care is not taken, the color is apt to be too intense. Dur- 
ing dipping, keep fondant over hot water that it may l)e 
kept of right consistency. For dipping, use a two-tined 
fork or confectioners' bonbon dipper. Droj) centres in 
fondant one at a time, stir until covered, remove from 
fondant, put on oiled paper, and bring end of dipper over 
the top of bonbon, thus leaving a tail-piece which shows 
that bonbons have been hand dipped. Stir fondant be- 
tween dippings to prevent a crust from forming. 

Cream Mints. 

Melt fondant over hot water, flavor with a few drops of 
oil of peppermint, wintei^reen, clove, cinnamon, or orange, 
and color if desired. Drop from tip of spoon on oiled 
paper. Confectioners use rubber moulds for shaping 
cream mints; but these are expensive for home use, 
unless one is to make mints in large (pian titles. 

Cream Nut Bars. 

Melt fondant and flavor, stir in any kind of nut meat, 
cut in pieces. Turn in an oiled pan, cool, and cut in bars 
with a sharp knife. Maple Fondant is delicious with nuts. 

Dipped 'Walnuts. 

Melt fondant and flavor. Dip halves of walnuts as 
bonbon centres are dipped. Halves of pecan or whole 
blanched almonds may be similarly dipped. 



456 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 



Tutti-Fnitti Candy. 

Fill an oiled boixler-inould with three layers of melted 
fondant. Have bottom layer maple, well mixed with EDg- 
liish walnut meat ; the second layer colored pink, flavorai 
with rose, ami mixed with candied cherries cut in quartern 
and tigs finely chopped; the thinl layer white, flavored 
with vanilla, mixed with nuts, candied cherries cut w 
quarters, and candied pineapple cut in small pieces. 
Cover mould with oiled paper, and let stand over night 
Remove from mould, and place on a plate covered with 
a lace paper napkin. Fill centime with Bonbons and 
Glace Nuts. 

Glac^ Nats. 

2 cups sugar. 1 cup boiling water. 

;^ teaspoon cream of tartar. 

Put ingredients in a smooth saucepan, stir, place on 
range, and heat to boiling point. Boil without stirring 
until syrup begins to discolor, which is 310° F. Wash off 
sugar which adheres to sides of saucepan as in making 
fondant. Remove saucepan from fire, and place in 
larger pan of cold water to instantly stop lK>iling. Re- 
move from cold water and place in a saucepan of hot 
water during dipjnng. Take nuts separately on a long 
pin, dip in syruj) to cover, remove from syrup, and place 
on oiled paper. 

Glace Fruits. 

P\)r Glaci' Fruits, grapes, strawberries, sections of 
mandarins and oranges, and candied cherries are most 
commonly used. Take grapes separately from clusters, 
leaving a short stem on each grape. Dip in syrup made 
as for (Hace Nuts, holding by stem with pincers. Remove 
to oiled paper, (ilace fruits keep but a day, and should 
only be attempted in cold and clear weather.

Spun Sugar. 



2 lbs. sugar. 2 cups boiling water. 

Ki teaspoon cream of tartar. 

Put ingreclieuts in a smooth saucepan. Boil without 
stirring until syrup begins to discolor, which is 310° F. 
Wash off sugar which adheres to sides of saucepan as in 
making fondant. Remove saucepan from fire, and place 
in a larger pan of cold water to instantly stop boiling. 
Remove from cold water, and place in saucepan of hot 
water. Place two broomstick-handles over backs of 
chairs, and spread paper on the floor under them. When 
syrup is slightly cooled, put dipi)er in syrup, remove from 
syrup, and shake quickly back and forth over broom- 
handles. Carefully take off spun sugar as soon as formed, 
and shape in nests or pile lightly on a cold dish. Syrup 
may be colored if desired. Spun Sugar is served around 
bricks or moulds of frozen creams and ices. 

Dippers for spinning sugar are made of coarse wires; 
about twenty wires, ten inches long, are put in a bundle, 
and fastened with wire coiled round and round to form 
a handle.

CHAPTER XXXIV. 
SANDWICHES AND CANAPES. 

IN preparing bread for sandwiches, cut slices as 
thinly as possible, and remove crusts. If butter is 
used, cream the butter, and spread bread before cutting 
from loaf. Spread half the slices with mixture to be 
used for filling, cover with remaining pieces, and cat 
in squares, oblongs, or triangles. If sandwiches are 
shaped with round or fancy cutters, bread should be 
shaped before spreading, that there may be no waste of 
butter. Sandwiches which are prepared several hours 
before serving-time may be kept fresh and moist by 
wrapping in a napkin wrung as dry as possible out of hot 
water, and keeping in a cool place. ParafMne paper is 
often used for the same purpose. Bread for sandwiches 
cuts better when a day old. Serve sandwiches piled on 
a plate covered with a doily. 

Rolled Bread. 

Cut fresh bread, while still warm, in as thin slices as 
possible, using a very sharp knife. Spread evenly witii

CHAPTER XXXV. 
RECIPES FOR THE CHAFINO-DISH. 

THE chafing-dish, which, within the last few years, 
has gained so much favor, is by no means a utensil 
of modern invention, as its history may be traced to the 
time of Louis XIV. It finds its phice on the breakfast 
table, when the eggs may be cooked to suit the most 
fastidious ; on the luncheon table, when a dainty hot dish 
may be prepared to serve in place of the so-oft-seen cold 
meat; but it is made of greatest use for the cooking of 
late suppers, and always seems to accompany hospitality 
and goocl cheer. 

It is appreciated and enjoyed by the housekeeper who 
does her own work, or has but one maid, as well as by the 
society girl who, by its use, first gains a taste for the art 
of cooking. The simple tin chafing-dishes may be bought 
for as small a sum as ninety cents, while the elaborate 
silver ones command as high a price as one hundred dol- 
lars. Very attractive dishes are made of granite ware, 
nickel, or copper. The latest patterns have the hinip with 
a screw adjustment to regulate the flame, and a metal tray 
on which to set dish, that it mav be moved if necessarv 
while hot, without danger of burnt fingm's, and that it may 
not injure tlie polished table. 

A chafing-dish has two pans, the nnder one for holding 
hot water, the upper one with h)ng handle for holding food 
to be cooked. A blazer differs from a chafing-dish, in- 
asmuch as it has no hot-water pan. 

Wood alcohol, which is much lower in price than high- 
proof spirits, is generally used in chafing-dishes.

CHAPTER XXXVI. 

COOEINa FRESERVmO, AND CANNING FRUITS. 

T^RUITS are usually at their best when sensed ripe and in 
^ season ; however, a few cannot be ttiken in their raw 
state, and still others are rendered more easy of digestion by 
cooking. The methods employed are stewing and baking. 
Fruit should be cooked in earthen or granite ware utensils, 
and silver or wooden spoons should be employed for stir- 
ring. It must be remembered that all fruits contain one 
or more acids, and when exposed to air and brought in con- 
tact with an iron or tin surface, a poisonous compound 
may be formed. 

Baked Apples. 

Wipe and core sour apples. Put in a liaking-dish, and 
fill cavities with sugar and spice. Allow one-half cup 
sugar and one-fourth teaspoon cinnamon or nutmeg to 
eight apples. If nutmeg is used, a few drops lemon juice 
and few gratings from rind of lemon to each apple is an 
improvement. Cover bottom of dish with boiling water, 
and bake in a hot oven until soft, basting often with syrup 
in dish. Serve hot or cold with cream. Many prefer to 
pare apples before baking. When this is done, core l>efore 
paring, that fruit may keep in shape. In the fall, when 
apples are at their best, do not add spices to apples, as 
their flavor cannot be improved ; but towards spring they 
become somewhat tasteless, and spice is an improvement.

one-half hour ; then add four pounds cut sugar and cut 
rind. Cook slowly two hours. Turn into glasses. 

CANNING AND PEESEEVING. 

Preser\'ing fruit is cooking it with from three-fourths 
to its whole weight of sugar. By so doing, much of the 
natural flavor of the fruit is destroyed ; therefore canning 
is usually preferred to preserving. 

Canning fruit is preser\nng sterilized fruit in sterilized 
air-tight jars, the sugar being added to give sweetness. 
Fruits may be canned without sugar if perfectly sterilized, 
that is, freed from all germ life.

482 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

DirectionB for Canning. 

Fruit for canning should be fresh, firm, of good qaality, 
and not over-ripe. If over-ripe, some of the spores may 
survive the boiling, then fermentation will take place in 
a short time. 

For canning fruit, allow one third its weight in sugar, 
and two and one-half to three cups water to each pound 
of sugar. Boil *sugar and water ten minutes to make a 
thin syrup ; then cook a small quantity of the fruit at a 
time in the syrup; by so doing, fruit may be kept in 
perfect shape. Hard fruits like pineapple and quince 
are cooked in boiling water until nearly soft, then pot 
in syrup to finish cooking. Sterilized jars are then filled 
with fruit, and enough syrup added to overflow jars. 1/ 
there is not sufficient syrup, add boiling water, as jars 
must be filled to overflow. Introduce a spoon hetween 
fruit and jar, that air bubbles may rise to the top and 
break ; then quickly put on rubbers and screw on steril- 
ized covers. Let stand until cold, again screw covers, 
being sure this time that jars ai-e air tight. While filling 
jars place them on a cloth wrung out of hot water. 

To Sterilize Jars. 

Wash jars and fill with cold water. Set in a kettle on 
a trivet, and surround with cold water. Heat gradually 
to boiling point, remove from water, empty, and fill while 
hot. Put covers in hot water and let stand five minntes. 
Dip rubber bands in hot water, but do not allow them to 
stand. New rubbers should be used each season, and 
care must be taken tliat rims of covers are not bent, a? 
jars cannot then be hermetically sealed. 

Canned Porter Apples. 

Wipe, quarter, core, and pare Porter apples, tiien 
weigh. Make a syrup by boiling for ten minutes one- 
third their weight in sugar with water, allowing two and 
one-half cups to each pound of sugar. Cook apples in 



CANXIKG AifV PKE8ERV1NG. 483 

syrup until soft, doing a few at a time. Fill jars, follow- 
inpc Directions for Canning. 

Canned Peaches. 

Wipe peaches and put in boiling water, allowing them 
to stand just long enough to easily loosen skins. Remove 
skins and cook fruit at once, that it may not discolor, 
following Directions for Canning. Some prefer to pare 
peaches, sprinkle with sugar, and let stand over night. 
In morning drain, add water to fruit syrup, bring to 
lx)iling point, and then cook fruit. Peaches may be cut 
in halves, or smaller pieces if desired. 

Canned Pears. 

Wipe and pare fruit. Cook whole with stems left on, 
or remove stems, cut in quarters, and core. Follow 
Directions for Canning. A small piece of ginger root or 
a few slicings of lemon rind may be cooked with syrup. 
Bartlett pears are the best for canning. 

Canned Pineapples. 
Remove skin and eyes from pineapples; then cut in 
half-inch slices, and slices in cubes, at the same time 
discarding the core. Follow Directions for Canning. 
Pineapples may be shre(hled and cooked in one-half their 
weight of sugar without water, and then put in jars. 
When put up in this way they are useful for the makhig 
of sherbets and fancy desserts. 

Canned Quinces. 
Wipe, quarter, core, and pare quinces. Follow Direc- 
tions for Canning. Quinces may be cooked with an 
equal weight of sweet apples ; in this case use no extra 
sugar for apples. 

Canned Cherries. 
Use large white or red dierries. Wash, remove stems, 
then follow Directions for Caiming. 



484 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

Canned Huckleberries. 
Pick over and wash berries, then put iu a presening 
kettle with a small quantity of water to prevent berrie« 
from burning. Cook until soft and put in jars. No 
sugar is required, but a sprinkling of salt is an agreeable 
addition. 

Canned Rhubarb. 

Fare rhubarb and cut in one-inch pieces. Pack in a 
jar, put under cold water faucet, and let water run twenty 
minutes, then screw on cover. Rhubarb canned in tiiis 
way has often been known to keep a year. 

Canned Tomatoes. 
Wipe tomatoes, cover with boiling water, and let stand 
until skins may be easily removed. Cut in pieces and 
cook until thoroughly scalded ; skim often during cook- 
ing. Fill jars, following directions given. 

Damson Preserves. 

Wipe damsons, and prick each fruit five or six times, 
using a large needle; then weigh. Make a syrup bv 
boiling three-fourths their weight in sugar with water, 
allowing one cup to each pound of sugar. As soon as 
syrup reaches boiling point, skim, and add plums, a few 
at a time, that fruit may better keep in shape during 
cooking. Cook until soft. It is well to use two kettles, 
that work may be more quickly done, and svrup need not 
cook too long a time. Put into glass or stone jars. 

Strawberry Preserves. 

Pick over, wash, drain, and hull 8trawl>erries ; then 
weigh. Fill jars with berries. Make a syrup same as for 
Damson Preserve, cooking syrup fifteen minutes. Add 
syrup to fruit to overflow jars; let stand fifteen min- 
utes, when fruit will have shrunk, and more fruit must be 
added to fill jars. Screw on covers, put in a kettle of 
cold water, heat water to boiling point, and keep j"st 
below boiling point one hour. 

Raspberries may be preserved in the same way.

CHAPTER XXXVII. 

RECIPES ESPECIALLY PBEPABED FOB THE SICK. 

OTATISTICS prove that two-thirds of all disease is 
^ brought about by error iu diet. The correct pro- 
lx>rtioas of food-priiiciples have not been maintained, or 
the food has been improperly cooked. Physicians ^ree, 
with but few exceptions, that the proper preparation of 
food for the sick fe of as great importance in the restora- 
tion to health as administration of drugs. Time and 
manner of serving are of equal importance. 

Take especial care in setting an invalid's tray. Cover 
with a spotless tray-cloth or dinner napkin, folding the 
same, if it is larger than tray, that it may just come over 
edge. Avoid a fringed cloth, as the fringe is apt to prove 
annoying. 

Select the daintiest china, finest, glass, and choicest 
silver, making changes as often as possible. Cheer the 
patient with a bright blossom laid on tray, or a small 
vase of flowers placed in left hand corner. Place plate at 
front of tray, near the edge ; knife at right of plate, with 
sharp edge toward plate; fork at left of plate, tines up; 
spoon at head of plate, or, if more convenient for the 
patient, at right of knife, bowl up; cup and saucer at 
right of plate, with handle arranged so that cup may be 
easily lifted; tumbler above knife, and filled two-thirds 
full of freshly drawn water just before taking into the 
sick-room. The individual butter, or bread and butter 
plate, should be placed at left hand corner over fork. 
The napkin may be placed at right of cup. Salt should 
appear, but pepper never. Avoid having too many things 
on the tray at one time. If soup, meat, and a light 



RECIPES PREPARED FOR THE SICK. 491 

dessert are to be served to a. convalescent, have one 
course removed before another appears. Foods which are 
intended to be served hot should be placed in heated 
dishes and kept covere<l during transit from kitchen, that 
patient may receive them hot. Equal care should be 
taken to have cold foods served cold ; never lukewarm. 
A glass of milk, cup of gruel, or cup of beef- tea should be 
on a plate covered with a doily. 

Never consult the patient as to his menu. If there is 
anything he especially desires, you will be informed. An- 
ticipation often creates appetite. Serve in small quanti- 
ties ; the sight of too much food often destroys the appetite. 
If liquid diet must be adhered to, give as great variety as 
is allowable. If patient is restricted to milk diet, and 
milk is somewhat objectionable, it may be tolerated by 
serving in different ways, — such as Koumiss, Albumenized 
Milk, or by addition of Apollinaris, Seltzer water, or 
rennet. 

After the completion of a meal, the tray should be re- 
moved at once from the sick-room. If any solid food 
remains, it should be burned, and liquids disposed of at 
once. 

Liquid Foods may first be considered. Barley water 
and rice water are known as astringent or demulcent 
drinks, and are generally used to reduce a laxative con- 
dition. The starch of l)arley is perhaps more valuable 
than that of rice. Toast water is often beneficial in 
eases of extreme nausea. A small quantity of clam water 
may be given when the stomach refuses to retain other 
foods. Clam water is also used to increase a secretion of 
mother's milk. 

Oatmeal water is occasionally oivlered for dyspeptic 
patients, but more frequently used for the workman on 
the road or the farmer in the field. In the hottest days of 
summer, oatmeal water may be drunk with safety where 
ice water would be extremely dangerous. 

Fruit waters are principally used for fever patients. 
They are cooling, refreshing, and mildly stunulating, and 



492 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

are valuable for the salts and acids they contaiiL Lemons, 
beinjr easily procured and of moderate price, are mwt 
extensively used. 

Beef essence, which is the expressed juices of beef, 
being nutritious, is given when a condensed form of food is 
necessary. Many preparations of beef essence are on 
the market in the form of powder, paste, liquid, aud taHy 
lets ; some of which are valuable, but they are more ex- 
pensive and not as nutritious as home-made essence, and 
patients are apt to quickly tire of them. One pound of 
beef cut from the top of the round will frequently yield 
four ounces of beef essence. 

Beef tea contains the juices of beef diluted with water, 
and is given as a stimulant, rather than as a nutrient 
as is popularly supposed. It furnishes a pleasing variety 
to a liquid diet, and by its use a large quantity of water is 
ingested. If the color of beef is objectionable to a 
l)atient, serve in a colored' glass. 

Egg-nogs are recommended where it is necessary to 
take a large amount of nutriment daily, as is often the 
case when the system is much reduced by a severe illness. 

Semi-solid Foods comprise the gruels. When made 
from corn or oatmeal they are heat-producing, and should 
never be given when inflammatory symptoms are present. 
Imperial Granum makes a delicious gruel, which has largely 
superseded the more conunon kinds. It is quickly made, 
and unless expense must be considered is generally to be 
preferred. Although containing much starch, in the 
process of manufacture the starch has largely been con- 
verted into dextrine ; therefore it may be given even when 
there is inflammation. Flour and cracker gruels to many 
prove a pleasant variety, and often assist in reducing a 
laxative condition. Arrowroot makes a delicate gruel, is 
more easily digested than any other form of starch, and is 
often valuable in eases of gastric irritation. It should 
never be given to infants. 

Solid Foods comprise the principal diet during convales- 
cence. At this time the nurse shows her skill and judg- 



KECIPES FREPAHED FOR THE SICK. 493 

ment quite as much as (iuriug the critical part of the 
(liseaBe. Foods must be taken which are nutritious, easy 
of assimilation, and given frec^uently, in small quantities, 
and at regular intervals. The convalescent, if allowed to 
follow his own inclinations, often prcxluccs a relapse by 
improper diet. 

It is often desirable to prepare water ices and ice creams 
quickly and in small quantities for the sick. This may be 
easily accomplished by putting the mixture to bo frozen 
in a small tin box (one-pound baking-powder can), plac- 
ing box in lard pail and surrounding with finely crushed 
ice and salt. Cover pail ; as mixture begins to freeze, 
scrape from sides and bottom of ])ox and beat until 
smootli. Continue until of the desired consistency.

2 cups cold water. Salt. 

Pick over rice, add to water, and boil until rice is 
tender; strain, and add to rice water, milk or cream as 
<lesired. Season with salt and reheat. A half-inch 
piece of stick cinnamon may be cooked with rice, and will 
assist in reducing a laxative condition.

RECIPES PREPARED FOR THE SICK. 499 

« 
Bottled Beef Essence. Strain and season. In reheating, 
care should be taken not to coagulate the juices. 

Beef tea contains albuminous juices, salts, and a very 
small amount of fat (so intermingled with the lean meat 
that it cannot be removed), together with that part of the 
meat which gives to it flavor and color. The fibre that 
remains contains much proteid in the form of insoluble 
albumen, which could not be extracted. Although the 
meat is tasteless, it still holds much nutriment, being 
deprived of but little other than its stimulating properties. 
When the albuminous juices of beef tea are allowed to co-' 
agulate, and tea is strained, it has about the same value 
as a cup of hot salted water. 

Frozen Beef Tea.

CHAPTER XXXVm. 

HBLPFUL HINTS TO THE YOUNO HOUSEKEEPER. 

To Scald Milk. Put in top of double boiler, having 
water boiling in under part. Cover, and let stand on 
top of range until milk around edge of double boiler has a 
bead-like appearance. 

For Battered Cracker Crumba, allow from one-fourth 
to one-third cup melted butter to each cup of crumbs. 
Stir lightly with a fork in mixing, that enimbs may be 
evenl}' coated and light rather than compact. 

To Cream Butter. Put in a bowl and work with a 
wooden spoon until soft and of creamy consistency. 
Should buttermilk exude from butter it should be poured 
off. 

To Extract Juice from Onion. Cut a slice from root 
end of onion, draw back the skin, and press onion on a 
coarse grater, working with a rotary motion. 

To Chop Parsley. Remove leaves from parsley. If 
parsley is wet, first dry in a towel. Gather parsley be- 
tween thumb and fingers and press compactly. With a 
sharp vegetable knife cut through and through. Again 
gather in fingers and recut, so continuing until parsley is 
finely cut. 

To Caramelize Sugar. Put in a smooth granite sauce- 
pan or omelet pan, place over hot part of range, and stir 
constantly until melted and of the color of maple syrup. 
Care must be taken to prevent sugar from adhering to 
sides of pan or spoon. 



506 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

To Make Canunel. Continue the caramelization of 
sugar until syrup is quite brown and a whitish smoke 
arises from it. Add an equal quantity of boiling water, 
and simmer until of the consistency of a thick syrup. Of 
use in coloring soups, sauces, etc. 

Acidulated Water is water to which vin^ar or lemon 
juice is added. One tablespoon of the acid is allowed to 
one quart water. 

To Blanch Almonds. Cover Jordan almonds with 
boiling water and let stand two minutes ; drain, put ihto 
cold water, and rub off the skins. Dry between towels. 

To Shred Almonds. Cut blanched almonds in tbin 
strips lengthwise of the nut. 

Macaroon Doat. Dry macaroons pounded and sifted. 

To Shell Cheatnata. Cut a half-inch gash on flat side.s 
and put in an omelet pan, allowing one-half teaspoon but- 
ter to each cup chestnuts. Shake over range until butter 
is melted. Put in oven and let stand five minutes. Re- 
move from oven, and with a small knife take off shells. 
By this method shelling and blanching is accomplished at 
the same time, as skins adhere to shells. 

Flavoring Extracts and Wine should be added if pos- 
sible to a mixture when cold. If added while mixture is 
hot, much of the goodness passes off with the steam. 

Meat Glaze. Four quarts stock reduced to one cup. 

Affized Mustard. Mix tT\'o tablespoons mustard and 
one teaspoon sugar, add hot water gradually until of tbe 
consistency of a thick paste. Vinegar may be used in 
place of water. 

To Prevent Bait from Lamping. Mix with com-starcb, 
allowing one teaspoon corn-starch to six teaspoons salt 



HINTS TO THE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER. 607 

To Wash Carafes. Half fill with hot soapsuds, to 
which is added ODe teaspoon washiug soda. Put in news- 
paper torn in small pieces. Let stand one-half hour, oc- 
casionally shaking. £mpty, rinse with hot water, drain, 
wipe outside, and let stand to dry inside. 

After Broiling or Frying;, if any fat has spattered on 
range, wipe surface at once with newspaper. 

To Remove Pruit Stains. Pour boiling water over 
stained surface, having it fall from a distance of three 
feet. This is a much better way than dipping stain in 
and out of hot water ; or wring articles out of cold water 
and hang out of doors on a frosty night. 

To Remove Stains of Claret l^ine. As soon as claret 
is spilt, cover spot with salt. Let stand a few minutes, 
then rinse in cold water. 

To Clean Graniteware where mixtures have been cooked 
or burned on. Half fill with cold water, add washing 
soda, heat water gradually to boiling point, then empty, 
when dish may be easily washed. Pearline or any soap 
powder may be used in place of washing soda. 

To Wash Mirrors and Windows. .Rub over with 
chamois skin wrung out of warm water, then wipe with 
' a piece of dry chamois skin. This method saves much 
strength. 

To Remove White Spots from Furniture. Dip a cloth 
in hot water nearly to boiling point. Place over spot, re- 
move quickly and rub over spot with a dry cloth. Repeat 
if spot is not removed. Alcohol or camphor quickly ap- 
plied may be used. 

Tumblers which have contained milk should be first 
rinsed in cold water before washing in hot water. 

To keep a Sink Drain free from grease, pour down once 
a week at night one-half can Babbitt's potasli dissolved in 
one quart water. 



508 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK.

one-fourth pound copperas dissolved in two quarts lioiling 
water. If this is not efficacious, repeat before sending for 
a plumber. 

Never put Knives with ivory handles in water. Hot 
water causes them to crack and discolor. 

To prevent GlaBsware from being easily broken, put in 
a kettle of cold water, heat gradually until water has 
reached boiling point Set, aside; when water is cold 
take out glass. This is a most desirable way to tougben 
lamp chimneys. 

To Remove Qrease Spots. Cold water and Ivory 
soap will remove grease spots from cotton and woollen 
fabrics. Castilian Cream is useful for black woollen 
goods, but leaves a light ring on delicately colored goods. 
Ether is always sure and safe to use. 

To Remove Iron Ruat. Saturate spot with lemon 
juice, then cover with salt. Let stand in the sun for sev- 
eral hours ; or a solution of hydrochloric acid may be used. 

Iron Ruat may be removed from delicate fabrics by 
covering spot thickly with cream of tartar, then twisting 
cloth to keep cream of tartar over spot ; put in a sauce- 
pan of cold' water, and heat water gradually to boiling 
point. 

To Remove Orasa Staina from cotton goods, wash in 
alcohol. 

To Remove Ink Staina. Wash in a solution of hycin> 
chloric acid, and rinse in ammonia water. Wet the 8fK)t 
with warm water, put on Sapolio, rub gently between the 
hands, and generally the spot will disappear. 

Cut Glasa should be washed and rinsed in water that 
is not very hot and of same temperature. 

In Sweeping Carpets, keep broom close to floor and 
work with the grain of the carpet. Occasionally torn 
broom that it may wear evenly. 



HINTS TO THE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER. 609 

Tie Strands of a New Broom closely together, put into 
a pail of boiling water, and soak two hours. Dry thor- 
oughly before using. 

Never wash the inside of Tea or Coffee Pota with soap- 
suds. If granite or agate ware is used, and becomes 
badly discolored, nearly fill pot with cold water, add one 
tablespoon borax, and heat gradually until water reaches 
the boiling point. Rinse with hot water, wipe, and keep 
on back of range until perfectly dry. 

Never put cogs of a Dover Bgg Beater in water. 

Never wash Bread Boards in a sink. Scrub with grain 
of wood, using a small brush. 

Before using a new Iron Kettle, grease inside and out- 
side, and let stand forty-eight hours; then wash in hot 
water in which a large lump of cooking soda has been 
dissolved. 

To clean a Copper Boiler, use Putz Pomade Cream. 
Apply with a woollen cloth when boiler is warm, not hot ; 
then rub off with second woollen cloth and polish T\itli 
flannel or chamois. If badly tarnished, use oxalic acid. 
Faucets and brasses are treated in the same way. 

A bottle containing Ozalio Acid should be marked 
poison, and kept on a high shelf. 

To keep an Ice Chest in good condition, wash thor- 
oughly once a week with cold or lukewarm water in which 
washing soda has been dissolved. If by chance anything 
is spilt in an ice chest, it should be wiped off at once. 

Milk and butter very quickly absorb odors, and if in 
ice chest with other foods, should be kept closely covered. 

Hard "Wood Floors and Furniture may be polished by 
using a small quantity of kerosene oil applied with a 
woollen cloth, then rubbing with a clean woollen cloth. 
A very good furniture polish is made by using equal parts 
linseed oil and turpentine. 



n 



510 BOSTON COOKLNG-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

Polish for Hard Wood Floors. Use one part bees^- 
wax to two parts turpentine. Put in saucepan on range, 
and when wax is dissolved a paste will be fonned. 

To clean Piano Keys, rub over with alcohol. 

To remove old Tea and Coffee Stains, wet spot with 
cold water, cover with glycerine, and let stand two or 
three hours. Then wash with cold water and hard soap. 
Repeat if necessary. 

Before Sweeping Old Carpets, sprinkle with pieces of 
newspaper wrung out of water. After sweeping, wipe 
over with a cloth wrung out of a weak solution of am- 
monia water; which seems to brighten colors. 

Piatt's Chloride is one of the best Disinfectants. Chlo- 
ride of lime is a valuable disinfectant, and much cheaper 
than Piatt's Chloride. 

Listerlne is an excellent disinfectant to use for the 
mouth and throat. 

To Make a Pastry Bag. Fold a twelve-inch square of 
rubber cloth from two opposite corners. Sew edges to- 
gether, forming a triangular bag. Cut off point to make 
opening large enough to insert a tin pastry tube. A set 
comprising bag and twelve adjustable tubes may be 
bought for two and one-half dollars. 

Smoked Ceilings may be cleaned by washing with 
cloths wrung out of water in which a small piece of 
washing soda has been dissolved. 

For a Burn apply equal parts of white of egg and 
olive oil mixed together, then cover with a piece of 
old linen; if applied at once no blister will form. Or 
apply at once cooking soda, then cover with dotb and 
keep the same wet with cold water. This takes out the 
pain and prevents •l)listering. 



HINTS TO THE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER. 511 

Curtail] and Portiere Poles allow the hangings to slip 
easily if rubbed with hard soap. This is much better than 
greasing. 

Creaking Doors and Drawers should be treated in the 
same way. 

To Remove Dust from Rattan Furniture use a small 
painter's brush.

A FULL COURSE DINNER. 

First Course. 

Little Neck Clams or Bluepoints, with brown-bread 
sandwiches. Sometimes canapes are used in place of 
either. For a gentlemen's dinner, canapes accompanied 
with sherry wine are frequently served before guests enter 
the dining-room. 



A FULL COURSE DINNBB. 621 

Second Course. 

Clear soup, with bread sticks, small rolls, or crisp 
crackers. Where two soups are served, one may be a 
cream soap. Cream soups are served with croutonp. 
Radishes, celery, or olives are passed after the soup. 
Salted almonds may be passed between any of the 
courses. 

Third Course. 

Bouchees or rissoles. The filling to be of light meat. 

Fourth Course. 

Fish, baked, boiled, or fried. Cole slaw, dressed cucum- 
bers, or tomatoes accompany this course ; with fried fish 
potatoes are often served. 

Fifth Course. 

Roast saddle of venison or mutton, spring lamb, or 
fillet of beef ; potatoes and one other vegetable. 

Sixth Course. 
Entr^, made of light meat or fish. 

Seventh Course. 

A vegetable. Such vegetables as mushrooms, cauli- 
flower, asparagus, artichokes, are served, but not in white 
sauce. 

Eighth Course. 

Punch or cheese course. Punch, when served, always 
precedes the game course. 

Ninth Course. 
Game, with vegetable salad, usually lettuce or celery ; 
or cheese sticks may be served with the salad, and game 
omitted. 

Tenth Course. 

Dessert, usually cold. 



622 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK. 

Eleventh Course. 

Frozen dessert and fancy cakes. Bonbons are passed 
after this course. 

Twelfth Course. 

Crackers, cheese, and caf^ noir. Cafe noir is frequently 
served in the drawing and smoking rooms after the 
dinner. 

Where wines and liquors are served, the first coarse is 
not usually accompanied by either ; but if desired, San- 
terne or other white wine may be used. 

With soup, serve sherry; with fish, white wine; irith 
game, claret ; with roast and other courses, champagne. 

After serving caf^ noir in drawing-room, pass pony of 
brandy for men, sweet liqueur (Chartreuse, Benedictine, 
or Parf ait d' Amour) for women ; then Cr6me de Mentbe 
to all. 

After a short time ApoUinaris should be passed. 
White wines and claret should be served cool; sherry 
should be thoroughly chOled by keeping in ice box. 
Champagne should be served very cold by allowing it to 
remain in salt and ice at least one-half hour before dinner 
time. Claret, as it contains so small an amount of 
alcohol, is not good the day after opening. 

For a simpler dinner, the thircj, seventh, eighth, and 
tenth courses, and the game in the ninth course may be 
omitted. 

For a home dinner, it is always desirable to serve for 
first course a soup; second course, meat or fish, with pota- 
toes and two other vegetables ; third course, a vegetAble 
salad, with French dressing; fourth course, dessert; fifth 
course, crackers, cheese, and caf^ noir. 

At a ladies' luncheon the courses are as many as at a 
small dinner. In winter, grape fruit is sometimes served 
in place of oysters ; in summer, selected strawberries in 
small Swedish Timbale cases.

Old Grist Mill Toasted Wheat 

THE TOASTED WHEAT IS A FERFECT HYGIENIC 
FOOD. 

As fresh bread becomes more easily digested by toast- 
ins:, so In our process of preparing and toasting: the 
Wheat the same chemical chanf^e takes place, which 
renders it easier of assimilation, at the same time givinj; 
it that delightful flavor which is so palatable, making 
the TOASTED WHEAT a delight to the robust and 
healthy, and a boon to the invalids and convalescents. 

Qive it freely to tlie clilidren ; they thrive on it, as 
It is not heating like Oat Meals and other Cereals. 

It contains all the health-giving qualities of the 
wheat : the phosphates, nitrates, and fat-producing 
qualities are fully retained, which are the necessary 
qualities for strengthening the bones, muscles, and 
nerves. 

An introduction of this remarkable Health Food to 
your family will demonstrate its wholesome and nutri- 
tious qualities, and render it an indispensable necessity 
of the breakfast table. 

Ask your g^rocer for a sample. If he does not 
carry it in stock, insist on his obtaining it for you. We 
will furnish the samples free.

Crimped Crust «. „ « 
Quaker Bread ^ ^ ^ 

Is the sweetest and best that can be turned out — dainty 
of crust, rich and moist inside. 

It is common-sense bread ; it is scientific bread. 

Every virtue of the flour, every aroma of the bread, is hdd 
as you never saw it before. 

It is more nutritious, and will keep longer than any other 
bread without becoming stale. 

The great secret is in the pan. Simple as a clothes- 
pin. It steams as well as bakes the bread, and never 
burns it. 

Quaker Crimped Crust Bread 

is especially recommended by Miss Fannie Mcrritt Faraicr.

Their German Sweet Chocolate is

is palatable, nutritious, and health- 
ful; a great favorite with children. 

Baron von Liebig, one of the best known writers on dietetics, says :— - 

"It [Cocoa] is a perfect food, as wholesome as delicious, a beneficent re- 
storer of exhausted power; but its quality must be good, and it must be 
carefully prepared. It is highly nourishing and easily digested, and is 
fitted to repair wasted strength, preserve health, and prolong life. It 
agrees with dry temperaments and convalescents; with mothers who 
nurse their children; with those whose occupations oblige them to 
undergo severe mental strains ; with public speakers and with all those 
who give to work a portion of the time needed for sleep. It soothes both 
stomach and brain, and for this reason, as well as for others, it is the best 
friend of those engaged in literary pursuits."
